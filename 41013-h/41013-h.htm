</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SINGING cannot be learnt from a book, and so far
from attempting any such impossible feat as writing
a book which might be called "<i>Singing without a
Master</i>," the author's object&mdash;frequently insisted upon herein&mdash;is
to point out the impossibility of overcoming the difficulties
of singing without a teacher. At the same time, there
are points upon which a master would not feel called upon to
speak; nor would he (except, perhaps, in the course of a very
long period of training) be likely to touch on many matters
which, though closely connected with the life or business of
an accomplished singer, yet lie rather outside the province of
the voice-trainer.</p>

<p>In a work consisting of detached paragraphs, and not being
a continuous essay, it is not always possible to enter into full
explanations of the reasons for certain statements; and (for
the want of such explanation) one paragraph may <i>appear</i> to
contradict another. However, I can assure the reader that
such paragraphs are only <i>apparent</i> contradictions; and if he
will take the trouble to think such points out for himself, he
will find that they are easily reconcileable.</p>

<p>There is no subject, perhaps, on which opinions are so
divided, and prejudices run so high, as the proper method of
training and using the voice; nor is there perhaps one more
wrapped in mystery than is the art of singing. This is probably
the result of that readiness with which almost every
music teacher has hitherto undertaken to teach Singing.
This book will not, I am sure, add to the mystery. A careful
perusal of its contents should clear away many misconceptions,
and place the student on the right road to that end
which he or she has in view.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h3>


<p>That another large edition of this little Manual should
be called for in so comparatively short a time is sufficiently
encouraging testimony of the worth of the book and the
favour it has found at the hands of students of singing and
others&mdash;a result the more gratifying to the publishers since
hitherto it has been issued with an anonymous title-page.
Often has the authorship of the little volume been industriously
defended and disputed&mdash;not by myself&mdash;both in this
country and America; but, on the whole, the identity of its
originator has been well maintained. For my part matters
might have remained so, especially as I am not insensible to
the fact that there is much "preaching" herein&mdash;as indeed
there must be in such a work, and some of the advice is of
such a nature that its giver runs the risk of being placed
upon an exceeding high pinnacle of moral excellence, or of
being accounted the personification of all the virtues&mdash;both
of which distinctions might scarcely be merited. The appearance
of my name upon the title-sheet is the result of no
wish of mine, and I have consented to it only out of deference
to the pressing request of the publishers.</p>

<p>A chapter on the Physiological Surroundings of the Voice
has been added to this edition.</p>

<p class="right">FREDERICK J. CROWEST.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>Once again my publishers have informed me of the
necessity for reprinting this Manual, which has been so
successful both here, in America, and in the Colonies. I
have nothing to alter in the work, but I must express my
thanks for the marked support that has been given to this
straightforward advice. Did space permit, much might be
said relative to that growing complaint, "Teachers' (or Board
School) Laryngitis" as it is called. For some time past
I have been authorized to make observations at the chief
Throat Hospitals in connection with this constantly increasing
mischief, arising from an injurious use of the voice
in Teaching, and which only proper Voice Production will
remedy. While I cannot give advice here, I shall be happy
to answer any communications of sufferers from this complaint.</p>

<p class="center xbig"><b>ADVICE TO SINGERS.</b></p>

<hr class="short" />


<h2><a name="PRELIMINARY_REMARKS" id="PRELIMINARY_REMARKS">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/009.png" width="75" height="75" alt="W" title="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap2">WHATEVER be the actual difference between the
professional and the amateur singer, if a person
is worthy of the name of singer at all, there
should be no difference in their views of Art,
and in their devotion to practice. Singing is an art, and
one of the most difficult of the arts to master; and any
one who attempts to learn it must be prepared to give the
same devotion to it as is demanded by the sister arts of
painting and sculpture. I do not mean exactly devotion
of the whole time and energy of life to it; because, however
necessary that may be for the professional, who has
to make his living by it, such entire devotion to an accomplishment
or an amusement (for such singing is to
the amateur) would, for a non-professional, be frequently
impossible, and very often wrong, as it would lead to a
neglect of the duties of life. But, while the entire devotion
of time and energy of a professional singer is
demanded to master the various styles, and the immense
mass of music, with which he or she will have to deal
in the exercise of the profession, the amateur should bear
in mind that such time and energy as he can devote to
singing must be firmly restricted to doing what he undertakes
thoroughly well&mdash;as well, in fact, as a professional.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
The amateur's position, which forbids him to make singing
the work of his life, limits the range of his work, not the
quality of it. He cannot, even if he have the voice of
a Rubini or a Braham, master the difficulties of opera,
oratorio, and ballad alike. Circumstances forbid him to
conquer the world, but there is no reason why he should
not be a king in his own special realm. To be that he
will have to follow the same rules as though he were able
to attack the whole universe of vocal music; for he should
feel that the only difference between him and the professional
singer lies in the sphere of their work.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply to many professionals. <i>Very</i>
few can excel in all styles, and few in more than one. To
attempt all is a great mistake, and will probably lead to
failure, or at least mediocrity in all.</p>

<p>But the first point that I would insist upon is the necessity
for earnest devotion and regular work, both in
professional and amateur, so that the term <i>Artist</i> may
apply to both. I shall be at no great pains to avoid
occasional repetitions of incidental remarks. In a book
intended for constant reference rather than for one perusal,
and one divided, as this is, into short paragraphs,
words may attract attention in one place, while in another
they may have been overlooked. If, therefore, I err in
this respect, I shall do so deliberately, my sole aim being
to help and impress the student as much as possible.</p>

<p>Remember that the human voice is the most delicate
of all instruments, susceptible to more and more varied
influence than any other. The singer has to combine in
himself the instrument and the performer; and while all
the artistic and intellectual qualities necessary for the instrumentalist
are required by him, he is compelled beyond
that to realize that he is a living instrument, and to exercise
over himself all the care&mdash;and indeed far more than all&mdash;that
players exercise over their most cherished "weapons."
He has not only to learn how to sing, but how to be and
to remain fit for singing. He, more than any other musical
artist, will find that he is affected by moral as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
physical and intellectual causes, and he must face this
fact boldly.</p>

<p>In writing down the brief hints which this little work
offers to singers, I shall therefore take in a range of subjects
and enter into many details which may seem to have
little to do with the practice of <i>Do</i>, <i>Re</i>, <i>Mi</i>. I do this
advisedly, and I believe that such hints as those on general
culture and habits of living are by no means the least important
part of my work. I do not profess to teach my
readers how to sing&mdash;(any singer knows, and I should like
the public to know too, that singing cannot be taught by a
book)&mdash;but to give "hints to singers," and many of those
hints are on such subjects as it would be an impertinence
on the part of a singing master to allude to. If the
student takes offence at the <i>book</i>, it happily does not
reach the author.</p>

<p>Following out the previous thought, I shall try to turn
the intending singer's attention to several other subjects,
before I touch upon that of strictly musical interest. And
if I here seem to "preach" occasionally, I shall never do
so without cause, and never, I trust, in any spirit but that
of the warmest sympathy with the aspirations and the
peculiar trials and difficulties of those who are still in full
vigour of youth and health.</p>

<p>Remember that I give <i>hints</i>, not <i>rules</i>. It is quite impossible
to lay down rules of living which shall apply alike
to male and female, or to variously constituted natures.
But I hope I may trust to the common sense of every
individual to draw sound conclusions, and to form his or
her own rules, by the help of these hints, and, the rules
once formed, to adhere to them resolutely. If singing
is to be done at all, it is worth while to do it well, and to
spare no pains to that end.</p>

<p>There is a good deal to be done by the student of singing
before he attacks the strictly musical part of his difficulties.
General education, if deficient, must be attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to; habits of living must be formed and followed out;
faults of character, such as laziness, ill temper, slovenliness,
impatience, and want of perseverance, must be bravely
fought; for the study of singing, perhaps more than of any
other art, will test the character severely in these respects.</p>

<p>The student must be prepared to exercise a good deal
of self-denial; to put aside all notions of self-merit for a
long time to come; and to be humble, and ready to take
a hint from any source. Whatever merits he may have
at starting are certainly not due to his own skill; they are
simply natural gifts, and the better they are, the more is
there for him to learn in doing justice to them. Let him
not waste time in admiring what he is, or has done; but
let him keep all his energy for what he may yet be and for
what he yet has to accomplish.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_HABITS" id="ON_HABITS">ON HABITS, DIET, &amp;c.</a></h2>


<p>The following paragraphs contain hints on various matters
apparently little connected with singing, yet all of more
or less importance to the singer. The voice, and the power
of using it, depend so greatly upon general health, and
health is so easily affected by habits of living, that I offer
no apology for entering into some details which, though
easy enough to write down, and read when written, would
be difficult for a singing master to allude to or suggest
without giving offence.</p>


<p><b>Early Rising.</b>&mdash;Practise early rising, and, if possible,
take a short walk before breakfast. This tends to keep the
circulation of the blood in a good condition, and that is,
of course, of great importance to the lungs, and all the
organs which singing requires to tax somewhat severely.</p>


<p><b>Cleanliness.</b>&mdash;Strict cleanliness is of the greatest importance.
Take a cold bath every morning directly you
get out of bed. Do not stand "pottering about," or you
may catch cold, but go to your bath while the skin is moist
with the perspiration which the warmth of bed has drawn
out. If you let the perspiration dry, and then plunge into
cold water, you run a great risk of giving yourself a severe
chill. Sponge yourself well, and rapidly, all over, especially
the chest, throat, back of the neck, and all round the loins;
and dry the body thoroughly and briskly with a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
towel. Let no fear of damaging the complexion deter
young ladies from this most healthy and necessary operation.</p>

<p>In winter, if the circulation is naturally sluggish, it is
as well not to take the bath perfectly cold, but merely add
enough hot water just to remove the extreme chill. The
bath ought to feel cold to you, even though it be not the
coldest possible.</p>

<p>It is well to take a warm bath once a week&mdash;if possible,
just before going to bed. Do not have it hot, but simply
warm, and, of course, use soap with it. Do not dawdle
over it, but "have it and have done with it," and then
get to bed at once. If you find the effect of it to be enervating
or relaxing, take it less warm in future. The object
of it is simply to open and cleanse the pores of the skin&mdash;a
matter of great importance.</p>


<p><b>The Hair.</b>&mdash;The same rule of extreme cleanliness
applies to the hair, and for the same reason, viz., its intimate
connection with the circulation of the blood and
the pores of the skin. Keep the hair well brushed, and
have it frequently cut and shampooed. Avoid "pomatums,"
washes, and greasy messes of every kind: their
smell is objectionable and their effect is generally to dirty
the head. Moreover, the public have the good taste to
object to the appearance of an artist before them who is
evidently "got up" with pains for the occasion. A person
who is habitually as clean as he can be, need never
fear to appear in public, and may spare himself the disgusting
application of "grease" to his head to make himself
fit to be seen.</p>

<p>If a moustache is worn, let it be kept within bounds,
and not allowed to fall over the mouth, where it would
affect the tone of the voice. Do not cut it straight along
the lip, but train it right and left, allowing it to grow
naturally and uncut. The advantages of the moustache
are two: it acts to a certain extent as a respirator, and
protects the mouth and throat as the eyelash does the
eye, and it helps to conceal any slight distortion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
mouth in singing. This, I confess, is a doubtful advantage:&mdash;there
ought to be no distortion, and if any were
seen, it might, perhaps, be corrected. However, I give
the opinion for what it is worth.</p>


<p><b>The Teeth.</b>&mdash;The teeth play such an important part
in the production of the voice that every care should be
taken to preserve them sound and in good condition&mdash;to
say nothing of the part which they play in facial expression,
a point to which every singer should attend. A bad state
of the teeth at once affects the stomach, and that again the
voice, so that no apology is needed for drawing the student's
attention to this matter. Clean the teeth the first
thing in the morning, and the last thing at night. Use a
moderately hard brush, better too soft than too hard, with
cold water, or better still, just lukewarm. Avoid all "dentifrices"
and advertised nastinesses in the way of powders
and "fragrant" washes. A mixture of powdered (not "prepared")
chalk and orris-root, in the proportion of about
three to two, is the best thing to use, and any chemist will
make that up for you. Remember to brush the teeth inside
and along the top, as well as outside; and if you find
this difficult with the ordinary-shaped brush, get one of
those which are sold for the purpose. If you find, in spite
of your care, that your teeth become discoloured, the cause
is probably that your stomach is out of order. In that case,
go straight to a doctor, for the consequence of such derangement
is that "tartar" is formed on the teeth, and
this grows, and pushes back the gums, altering the form
of the cavity of the mouth, and so affecting the tone of
the voice.</p>


<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Be as much as you can in the open air.
Take moderate walking exercise, but of course do not tire
yourself before singing or practising. For male singers,
rowing, riding, football and cricket (but without the shouting
so often incidental to these games), racquets or tennis,
and above all an hour or two weekly in a gymnasium, are
excellent things; while for ladies, walking, riding, lawn-tennis,
"la grace," and calisthenics are equally useful. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
you live in a town, always walk in preference to taking a
conveyance, when time and weather permit it.</p>

<p>Never breathe through your mouth in walking, especially
at night, or on coming out into the open air after singing.
Keep the lips closed, and inhale the air through the
nostrils. This is easily acquired, and to be able to do this
will be found of great service in taking breath for singing;
but out of doors it is most important, for the immediate
rush of cold or damp air to the delicate organs of the
throat, especially when the latter have been excited by the
exertion of singing, is dangerous. It is a good plan, and
a profitable use of the time, to practise breathing when
walking, by filling the lungs, and utilizing each inspiration
for as long a distance as possible.</p>


<p><b>Dress.</b>&mdash;Nothing can be said in favour of our climate
for singing. With proper precautions, however, a great
deal of trouble arising from this cause may be averted. In
summer, as well as in winter, for instance, the writer would
strongly urge the wearing of moderately thick-soled boots
or shoes. Then, again, the neck and chest should never be
exposed alike to a June sun and a December frost; but,
instead, it should be moderately and reasonably covered.
Great care should be taken never to get wet, especially
wet or damp feet.</p>

<p>In going out of hot rooms into the open air much pains
should be exercised to keep the chest and throat covered
up with an overcoat or cloak&mdash;however warm the weather
may be. In <i>very severe</i> winter weather the singer will
derive much comfort by wearing a flannel chest-protector.
Sitting about in gardens, and on lawns, in the evenings
on even the warmest days, is not a safe indulgence for the
student who is in earnest in the pursuit of his art.</p>

<p>One caution is necessary as to "wrapping up," however.
Do not over-do it. The constant use of a "comforter"
renders the throat delicate and susceptible. All you have
to fear is damp, not cold, in the atmosphere. A comforter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
closely wound round the throat, promotes perspiration,
and the risk of chill in removing it is greater than in not
wearing it at all. Common sense must guide every one.
It is impossible to make a rule for all.</p>


<p><b>Diet.</b>&mdash;As to diet: avoid everything that is at all indigestible.
Live well, and take plenty of varied nourishment.
The singer's system <i>must</i> be well nourished. Chocolate
and coffee are better than tea; the latter is too astringent,
and affects the nerves too much, if taken in abundance.
Sugar, in moderation, should always be used with those
beverages, and they should never be taken very hot. Bread
is better than toast, but avoid hot or very new bread. Eggs
and butter are good. Meat should be plainly cooked and
not too well done. Pork tries the digestion too severely
to be a desirable food for a singer, and the same may be
said of veal. Fish is good for the singer, and he should if
possible let it form a part of his daily <i>menu</i>. Creams and
pastry are simply poison, and cheese should only be taken in
great moderation. Fruit is an excellent thing if judiciously
used. But here, again, hard and fast rules are impossible,
because constitutions vary. Only remember the old proverb,
"We must eat to live, and not live to eat."</p>

<p>Never practise or sing upon an empty stomach, or soon
after a meal: either of these habits will unfairly tax your
digestive organs, and in so doing damage your voice.
After a meal, all the energy of the body is required for
the stomach; in a healthy person the extremities will generally
be cold after a full meal, and the reason is that the
digestive organs are using all the heat and blood that the
body can give for their special work. Nature thus points
to a rest of every other organ at that time, and you must
not fight against Nature by attempting any such severe
physical strain as the practice of the voice demands.</p>

<p>All acids and astringents are bad for a healthy throat
and stomach. Vinegar, highly-flavoured sauces, almonds
and raisins, nuts of every kind should be avoided. Some
of these are useful as remedies in relaxed throat, or congestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the throat, no doubt; but I am speaking simply
of what is desirable for a person in a state of health. In
cases of cold, hoarseness, or indisposition of any kind, my
prescription is, "Don't doctor yourself, but (as Abernethy
said) '<i>Take advice</i>.'" Be very careful and abstemious in
the use of spirits. Brandy is decidedly injurious, it heats
and inflames the throat, and tends to constipate the bowels.
Gin or whiskey is the most wholesome spirit, but take as
little as possible of either. If you drink beer or stout, take
draught and not bottled, and always in great moderation.
All effervescing liquors are objectionable; therefore eschew
champagne, Moselle, bottled ale and stout, <i>et hoc genus
omne</i>. The fluids called port and sherry are cruel foes to
singing. A glass of <i>good</i> port is a fair medicine in certain
cases, and the same may be said of very dry Amontillado,
but if you have nothing the matter with you, avoid port
and (so-called) sherry&mdash;especially the hideous compound
of alcohol and molasses known as "brown" sherry&mdash;as you
would poison.</p>

<p>The best drink for singers is claret, or any light wine,
French, German, or Italian. I myself find the latter on
the whole the best, and such wines as Barolo Secco or
Chianté are pure and cheap, and contain all the properties
necessary for a singer's beverage. But in this as in all
else, <i>moderation</i> is a <i>sine quâ non</i>. Fluids are apt to produce
congestion or mucus in the throat and glands of the
mouth, and that of course interferes with the free action
of the muscles in singing.</p>


<p><b>Smoking.</b>&mdash;As a general rule it may be laid down that
smoking is a bad habit for the singer, male or female (for
there are females who are proud of being able to smoke
cigarettes nowadays!). With many instances of great
singers who have also been great smokers before us, it is
impossible to say decidedly that singers must not smoke;
but the habit is one to be very cautiously indulged in. If
smoking in any case induces expectoration, it should at
once be given up, for the habit of spitting, to which some
smokers allow themselves (quite needlessly) to give way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is, in reality, the greatest evil of smoking; it weakens the
throat, lungs, and chest. If a man can smoke without
spitting or drinking, I confess that I am no great enemy
to tobacco; but the "if" is a big one.</p>

<p>A cigarette is certainly a safeguard against taking cold
in coming out of a hot room into the open air, especially
after singing; but strong cigars or strong tobacco in pipes
are to be avoided, because of their effect on the nerves.</p>


<p><b>Late Hours.</b>&mdash;Avoid late hours. You require, not
only a certain amount of sleep, but to take that sleep before
the body and mind are at all overtaxed. From many causes,
it is well known, the human frame is always at its lowest
from about 2 a.m. till 5 a.m., and the nearer you approach
those hours in going to bed, the less able are you to derive
all the benefit which you require from sleep. Twelve
o'clock is late enough for any one.</p>

<p>Another reason why late hours are bad is connected
not with physical facts so much as with morals. It is true,
you may come to no actual harm, or get into no positive
mischief, by being out late at night, but you place yourself
in a position of risk&mdash;risk of cold, over-fatigue, inhaling
vitiated atmosphere, &amp;c., as well as risk to moral character,
which latter, in its way as delicate as the voice, is injured
not only by actual violation of right, but by all society,
conversation, and literature which tend to dim its brightness,
or (to use another metaphor) to spoil the purity of
its outline by roughly knocking off its corners. At all
events, as to the night side of "Life," you are better out
of it.</p>


<p><b>Morality.</b>&mdash;Nothing can act more prejudicially upon
a singer than those influences which are understood by
that very inclusive term, a "fast" life. I would, therefore,
urge upon the student the necessity of a religious avoidance
of those influences. They dull the purity of thought which
marks all true art; they deaden the intellect which art
requires; and they injure the physical powers, without
which all a singer's study may be suddenly rendered useless
to him. All excess is bad, and self-restraint and self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
are of the greatest importance both to character and health.
Many an anxious student has mastered the musical side
of his art, but has failed under the rigid demands which
the moral code makes upon an intending singer. It is
of no use for a singer to be strong musically, and weak
morally: the two preparations must go hand-in-hand; and
while building up a structure of vocal greatness, his care
must always be that the moral foundation will always
support the weight of persistent study, and leave him
favourably placed in the stern competition going on around
him for a front place in the race for singing fame, and the
inevitable honours. Keep these hints in mind, think them
carefully over, and be your own moral doctor. That will
be better than following any code of cut and dried rules.
If you err at all, let it be on the side of self-denial, the
hardest and probably the highest of all virtues.</p>

<h2><a name="PRONUNCIATION" id="PRONUNCIATION">ON THE STUDY OF PRONUNCIATION
AND "WORDS" IN SINGING, &amp;c.</a></h2>


<p>The singer has to combine the arts of the musician, the
public speaker, and, to a certain extent, the actor.
Clearness of pronunciation and correctness of emphasis
are included in the range of his study. Nor are these so
easy of acquirement as many persons suppose. To a
novice, the almost inevitable nervousness inseparable from
the prominent position which a solo singer necessarily
holds in the company, or before the audience to which he
is singing, is very apt to render the enunciation less
distinct and more rapid than is natural to him. His ear
guides him less safely; and, in fact, every sense, influenced
by the abnormal state of his nerves, is apt to play him
more or less false. It is only by having carefully studied
and mastered every detail of manner, posture, and speech,
as well as of the music to be performed, that a singer can
rise superior to the treachery of his nerves, in whatever
form that treachery may show itself.</p>


<p><b>Nervousness.</b>&mdash;A few words as to nervousness.
You will often hear persons boast that they are not the
least nervous in public; and, perhaps, will feel inclined
to envy them. Get rid of any such notion at once. If
by "nervous" is meant "frightened," that is another thing
altogether; and it is perfectly true that there are hundreds
of persons who are not in the least afraid of appearing in
public, nor affected by timidity when so appearing. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
fear is only one form of nervousness. I firmly believe
that it is impossible for a real artist ever to appear in
public without being <i>nervous</i>. But the nerves act in
many ways: the fervour of an eloquent speaker carried
away by his subject; the "<i>abandon</i>" of a fine actor
thoroughly entering into his part and identifying himself
with it; the sustained energy of a declamatory singer;
the faultless and unerring agility of a florid <i>soprano</i>, who
astonishes her hearers by wonder on wonder of execution&mdash;all
these things are due, in their subtle charm, to
nervousness&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to delicate nervous organization in active
play. These artists are not frightened, it is true, but excited,
stimulated, roused from the normal state of eating,
walking, and sleeping; something of the spiritual kindles
the mere physical forces in them&mdash;some breath of inspiration
sustains that living power which so influences
the hearers. In some way or other every great artist is
always nervous; were it not so, the essence of their power
would vanish. Persons of cold and phlegmatic temperament
lack the very life-breath of art; and though they
may train themselves into fair imitations of some great
artists, they will generally be detected with ease, by any
hearer of true sensibility, as imitations, not the real thing.
Therefore do not be ashamed to admit that you are
nervous, if it be so. Nerves are a cruel master, but a
splendid servant; instead of letting them overcome you,
force them to do your bidding; and instead of "nervousness"
meaning "fear," you will find that it means courage
and power to do your best.</p>


<p><b>Pronunciation.</b>&mdash;Study correctness of pronunciation
and propriety of emphasis quite apart from singing.
Remember that in speaking or singing in a large space
and to a number of persons, every sound must have not
only additional force, but additional volume. And that
comes to mean that every vowel-sound in the words sung
must be intensified, and every consonant be delivered
with more accuracy than is necessary in ordinary speaking.
If you were to pronounce the syllable "die" (for instance),
in singing, <i>exactly</i> as you do in speaking, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
produce on the notes or note to which that word belonged
a thinness of tone which would be very ugly, and probably
would not "carry" far. And the same with any vowel-sound&mdash;even
"Ah," or "Oh,"&mdash;which, though not producing
a thin tone, would certainly produce a coarse one,
if sung exactly as spoken in ordinary conversation.</p>


<p><b>Vowel-Sounds.</b>&mdash;The reason of the need of this
slight change is as follows. Every vowel-sound, like
every musical sound (for vowel-sounds are nothing less
than musical sounds) is composed of <i>two</i> sounds. Combined
with the prominent and chief sound which first
attracts the ear is a second, which, though not prominent,
lends point and force to the other. Thus our English
vowel-sound "A" is really <i>&#201;h-é</i>; "E" is <i>E-é</i>; "I" is
<i>Ah-é</i>; "O" is <i>O-óo</i>, or even <i>Aw-oo</i>; "U" is <i>&#201;e-óo</i>. Of
course, I do not mean to say that those absurd-looking
syllables really express exactly the sounds which we produce
in speaking the vowels, for no combination of letters
can do that, or can bring within reach of the eye the
subtleties of sound in human speech; but if you attempt
to pronounce those syllables, you will find that you are
really pronouncing the vowels from which I "translated"
them.</p>

<p>Now, in conversation or rapid speaking, the subordinate
sound of the vowel is scarcely noticeable, while the
more prominent sound is heard for the short interval of
time required. But in singing or public speaking, where
the production of tone is more deliberate, the space to be
filled with sound larger, or, in other words, the column of
air to be set vibrating is greater and heavier, the <i>complex</i>
sound of the vowel must not be ignored. It is impossible
to lay down any set of rules by which the student may
overcome this difficulty; but every one, by bearing in
mind the absolute necessity of attention to this point,
may easily accustom himself to the slight change of pronunciation
(as it will at first appear) which is required to
give vowel-sounds when sung, or spoken "<i>ore rotundo</i>,"
the same tone, to the hearer's ear, as they have in ordinary
speaking. As a general rule this is done by keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
throat more open, the larynx (or "Adam's apple") as low
down as possible, and the root of the tongue flat, depressed,
even hollowed like the bowl of a spoon. The truth of all
this may easily be tested by singing any short passage
deliberately and distinctly, with the exact pronunciation
of ordinary speaking, and then repeating it with attention
to the above hints. In the first instance the result will
be meagre, hard to be heard at a moderate distance, and
very likely extremely ludicrous to the hearer. In the
second, you will find that the tone of the notes gains in
roundness and fulness, while the words are clearly heard
in every part of the room with the exact effect belonging
to them. I purposely refrain from attempting to write
down the difference discernible in any words so sung,
because, as I have already said, <i>letters</i> cannot accurately
express distinctions so delicate, yet so all-important to the
singer, speaker, and hearer.</p>


<p><b>Consonants.</b>&mdash;In pronouncing consonants, be careful
to give each its due value, but without exaggeration. Be
especially particular to sound the <i>last</i> letter of each word
distinctly. But take care to avoid adding a slight sound
(as of an <i>e</i> mute) after the final letter: for instance, do
not say "When other-<i>é</i> lips," &amp;c., or "bright-<i>é</i> days,"
and so on. Do not over-aspirate the letter "<i>H</i>." "<i>N</i>,"
"<i>L</i>," "<i>M</i>," "<i>B</i>," "<i>P</i>," and "<i>V</i>," are all letters requiring
care in firm pronunciation.</p>

<p>Avoid prefixing a slight sound of "<i>N</i>" to the first word
of a song or passage in singing. It is a common trick with
beginners to do this, and they frequently do it without
being in the least conscious of it. It is produced by a
kind of nervous feeling of the teeth with the tongue, as if
to make sure that all is right for the start! I have heard
an aspiring youth actually begin a well-known song thus:
"<i>Nwaft her Rangels Nthrough the sky</i>," &amp;c.</p>


<p><b>English Words.</b>&mdash;The English language is not the
most suitable one under the sun for singing purposes;
nevertheless, it is not nearly so intolerable and unfavourable
an one as it is the fashion to make out. The grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
old Scripture passages which Handel, Mendelssohn, and
others have set to music testify to this. Yet musical care
<i>is</i> needed when singing English words, and especially in
pronouncing the "sibilants," as <i>S</i>, &amp;c. These "sibilants"
must never be enunciated rapidly, or their ill effects will
soon be found in a series of <i>hissings</i>. Let it be your study,
then, to avoid this ill effect in singing English words, and
to utter such sounds slowly and carefully, with the endeavour
to produce a soft and agreeable effect; for it is,
indeed, unpardonable to hear an English singer unable to
render perfectly the words (if <b>not</b> the music) of his native
country's songs and ballads.</p>


<p><b>Emphasis.</b>&mdash;Having accustomed yourself to carefulness
over each letter in your pronunciation, the next thing
is to study correctness of emphasis, &amp;c. All this is apart
from the strictly musical portion of your studies, and, while
you can work at this without music, you will certainly spoil
the effect of your singing (however good your voice and
voice production may be), unless you do so study your
"words." I should recommend you to practise reading
aloud for not less than a quarter of an hour at a time, say
once a day. Read <i>standing</i>; place your book on a desk,
on a level with your eyes, and speak out deliberately, and
with full tone of voice, and as much variety of intonation
as the matter read requires. Shakespeare is your best
author for this study. You will feel at first as if you were
doing a very absurd thing, but never mind that&mdash;do it, and
do it as well and as carefully as you can.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Lips.</b>&mdash;In speaking and reading
aloud during your preliminary training for singing, be very
careful that there be no change in the aperture of the mouth
or position of the lips while uttering any one sound, however
prolonged. If the lips move from their first position,
however slightly, the tone immediately changes, and the
pronunciation ceases to be pure and refined.</p>


<p><b>Study of Words.</b>&mdash;The words of a song are as much
worthy of the singer's study as the music, that is, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
song is worth singing at all. I do not mean to say that
in themselves they must necessarily be of equal merit, but
that they require as much attention on the part of the
singer to bring out their meaning. Study the text, therefore,
apart from the music. Read the words aloud deliberately;
master the sentiment of them, and note the prominent
words and phrases, so as to be able to give them
their due value when you have to combine them with the
music. Avoid giving prominence to such words as "of,"
"for," "the," "and," "in," &amp;c., &amp;c., but yet let each be
distinctly pronounced, and not slurred over in an indefinite
murmur. Learn the words of your song by memory.
Master the text, and consider the whole from an elocutionist's
point of view before you attack the musical side of the
matter. A singer when singing in public should not be
troubled with his words and music too.</p>


<p><b>General Education.</b>&mdash;An important branch of study
is that of giving expression to the passions, and of communicating
your conceptions and emotions to the minds
of your listeners. No better training could a young singer
have for forming such ideas than the earnest perusal of
the works of Shakespeare, Dante, Goethe, Milton, Lytton,
George Eliot, &amp;c.; or in watching carefully and intelligently
the acting of our best stage performers. For a
singer to be successful, he or she must be in a position to
express, and bring home to an audience, such emotions
as love, hatred, anger, fear, grief, and pity; all these, and
many other such feelings, have constantly to be transmitted
by the singer, and it is to the most natural and
faithful exposition of these, and that most consistent with
the other equally important points of the art of singing,
that the student's attention should for a long while be
patiently and perseveringly directed.</p>

<p>The singer should be a well-educated man, and he
should know at least one other language beside his native
tongue. He should be well read, too, in the best literature
of these two languages. On questions of all the arts
he should seek to make his views sound and true. He
should seek to travel, and so enlarge his mind, for all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
training will reflect itself in the work of an artist so liberally
educated. An inferior education has been the bane of
many a student, who has had the organ and all the necessary
musical ability.</p>


<p><b>Dramatic Study.</b>&mdash;To be a successful public singer,
even in the concert-room, one must be more or less an
actor; and, therefore, the time and money bestowed in
acquiring a sound knowledge of dramatic action and
elocution will be well spent. For the lyric stage, such
a study is imperative; but its utility to artists who aspire
no higher than to ballad or oratorio singing cannot be
too highly estimated.</p>

<h2><a name="VOICE_QUALITY" id="VOICE_QUALITY">VOICES AND THEIR VARIOUS
QUALITIES.</a></h2>


<p>The life of the singing voice is so comparatively short,
that the study of singing is rendered more difficult than
that of any other art. You may buy a violin or a pianoforte,
ready-made and perfect, in your childhood, and nothing
remains for you but to study the instrument diligently
under a good master. But the vocal instrument cannot
be said to exist at all, for purposes of singing study, before
the age of eighteen or twenty in males, and (in our climate)
sixteen in females. Even at those ages the organ is necessarily
immature and undeveloped. Consequently the
study of the art has to be carried on during the progress
of the instrument to maturity.</p>

<p>To counterbalance this disadvantage, however, we must
bear in mind that that very study materially helps to perfect
the instrument. Singing is by no means all "style,"
and the study of it includes the formation of the voice and
production of a good tone, and it is, of course, easier to
manipulate an unfinished article than a finished one&mdash;to
educate youth and suppleness than to bring maturity and
stiffness into subjection to new conditions.</p>

<p>Therefore begin your study in the youth of your voice;
but, recollecting that its life is the most short-lived of your
faculties, let your study be most earnest and painstaking.
Especially if singing is to be your profession, act upon the
wise advice of Dr. Burney, and "Never go to bed till you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
have learned something which you did not know the
previous night."</p>


<p><b>Voices.</b>&mdash;"What is your voice?" is a very common
question, sometimes expressed in the rather less polite but
more intelligent form, "What do you call your voice?"
The answer almost invariably is either "Soprano," "Contralto,"
"Tenor," "Bass," or "Barytone." Here is a warning
for you at starting. Do not limit your notions of what
voices are to those four or five generic names. Because
choral music is generally written in four parts, for soprano,
alto, tenor, and bass, the non-musical public, and a great
many musical people (some composers included) seem to
think that those names are an inclusive description of
every human voice.</p>

<p>This would be of very little consequence if it were only
a question of names; but it is of no use to say "What is
in a name?" if the result of a wrong name is to lead to
mischief. The misfortune of wrongly naming your voice
is that it will lead you to practise wrongly, and to choose
the wrong style of music for study and performance. For
instance, a young lady may call herself a <i>soprano</i> because
she can "<i>sing up to C</i>," and may therefore fancy that the
whole repertoire of a Tietjens or a Clara Novello is within
her reach; and acting on this notion, she may fatally
damage a naturally bright and pleasing voice by giving it
work to do which belongs of right to a voice of totally
different calibre, the <i>mezzo-soprano</i>.</p>


<p><b>Naming the Voice.</b>&mdash;Remember always that the
character of a voice is determined not by compass or range
of notes, but by quality, or body and <i>timbre</i>, of tone. Two
ladies may have voices ranging from A to A&mdash;two octaves&mdash;and
yet one might be a pure light soprano, and the
other a genuine contralto; while in length of compass a
mezzo-soprano may even beat them both. And so with
male voices (the variety in which is even greater than in
female), you may have a voice of pure tenor quality, and
yet of such limited compass that your energetic barytone
friend next door may make your life miserable with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
jealousy of the ease with which he bellows high Gs, G
sharps, and even on great occasions an A or so.</p>

<p>But compass has nothing whatever to do with the name
of the voice: it may limit the quantity of music which can
be performed, but it should have no influence on the choice
of the style of music to be studied. This is a point of the
greatest importance, therefore I repeat it briefly once more&mdash;<i>Your
voice must be described and used with reference to its
quality, or volume and timbre, and not with reference to the
number of notes which you can sing.</i></p>


<p><b>Male and Female Voices.</b>&mdash;The actual varieties
in tone and quality in different voices cannot, of course,
be expressed on paper; but a careful use of your ears in
listening to good public singers will soon teach you to
discriminate. Female voices are of at least four kinds:
soprano, mezzo-soprano, mezzo-contralto, and contralto.
Male are of five or six, or even more. Alto; tenore-leggiero
or light tenor; tenore-robusto or strong heavy-voiced
tenor; barytone&mdash;basso-cantante (erroneously
identified with the barytone by some persons); basso-profondo
or bass.</p>

<p>Beside all these divisions or species, voices must be
again classed according to their power. Any one who has
ever heard an opera singer in a moderate-sized private
drawing-room, will readily appreciate the difference between
a <i>voce di camera</i>, or "chamber voice," and a <i>voce
di teatro</i>.</p>


<p><b>Compass.</b>&mdash;The respective compasses of the several
voices may be roughly set down as follows, but it should
be borne in mind that it is by no means a matter of course
that a singer of any particular voice should possess or cultivate
the whole range of notes supposed to belong to
that voice. He or she may be none the less a tenor or
a soprano because the one cannot produce an "<i>Ut de
poitrine</i>," or the other "<i>F</i> in <i>Alt</i>." There is a special individuality
in every voice, as in every face, and therefore
every voice must be treated, by a good teacher, on its
own merits, as a thing in some respects unique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it will be best, therefore, instead of saying that
the compass of any given kind of voice is from &mdash;&mdash; to &mdash;&mdash;,
to say that music for such and such a voice is generally
written between such and such limits. The range allotted
by composers to the various voices is about two octaves
to each&mdash;for solo work, of course&mdash;and is as follows, it
being understood that the male voices are an octave lower
in pitch than the female:&mdash;</p>

<p>The basso-cantante is a low barytone, or high bass with
a lighter quality of tone than the basso-profondo. The
alto voice, or counter-tenor as it used to be called, is not
a natural voice at all, but is artificially produced by training
the <i>falsetto</i> to the exclusion of the other parts of the
voice. It is totally distinct from the contralto voice of a
female, in quality, average compass, and the style of music
best suited to it. It is of more use in part-singing and
cathedral music than for solo work, although in some
oratorios solo parts have been allotted to it. It is rarely
pleasing when heard alone, for very few alto singers are
able to avoid the appearance of singing with effort; and
the whole performance, except in some instances, appears
unnatural and forced. The alto voice ranges generally</p>

<p><b>Soprano.</b>&mdash;The soprano is generally clear, bright, and
penetrating in tone; capable, if rightly produced, of
"carrying" far without any appearance of force or effort.
Its lower register is often weak and ineffective, and the
forcing of those notes by a bad singer often damages the
voice, and spoils the evenness of tone, which is of far more
importance than power and noise in singing. Low notes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
even if naturally weak, may be trained to take their proper
share of the work of the voice, and every year will add
to their natural power. Most soprano voices have a
"break" on</p>

<p>The lower notes are the (so-called) "chest" register; the
middle ones, between the breaks, the "falsetto," and the
upper ones the "head" notes. I shall speak of these
often-used and frequently-misapplied words presently; I
merely mention them now for the sake of pointing out to
soprani, what many young lady amateurs utterly ignore,
that they have these "breaks," and possess "chest,"
"falsetto," and "head" notes, as well as male singers.</p>

<p>Soprano voices are frequently capable of great flexibility,
and passages are easy to them which tax the powers even
of a light mezzo-soprano severely. The high notes, especially,
are in many cases easily produced in a staccato
manner, like notes of a piccolo flute, and an effect is thus
made, which, though pretty and pleasing if judiciously
employed, becomes a great snare to many singers, who
for the sake of astonishing their audience work the upper
part of their voices unfairly, and, neglecting steady use
and practice of the lower registers, will very soon find that
they have weakened the power and thinned the tone of
the whole voice.</p>

<p>But there are many voices of pure soprano tone which
lack this flexibility: let the fair owners console themselves
with the recollection that good <i>sostenuto</i> singing is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
as pleasing, in the long run, as displays of vocal gymnastics.
You may not be able to attempt the "<i>Dinorah</i>" Shadow
Song, or the "Rejoice Greatly" in the "<i>Messiah</i>," but you
will find that you have plenty of good work left for you
in such music as "Dove Sono," "Deh vieni, non tardar"
("<i>Figaro</i>"), or "Jerusalem" ("<i>St. Paul</i>").</p>

<p>Moreover, you may possibly have what is a much rarer
gift (in a pure soprano) than flexibility&mdash;you may have a
tone of voice capable of executing declamatory music with
fine effect. Music of this kind is generally appropriated
by some mezzo-soprano of high compass, and more properly
belongs to voices of that class; nevertheless, the
effect of sustained declamatory music, well executed by a
real soprano, is unrivalled in its way.</p>


<p><b>Mezzo-Soprano.</b>&mdash;The mezzo-soprano voice is perhaps
the commonest of all female voices, and yet one of the
rarest met with in perfection. It is fuller and rounder in
quality than the soprano&mdash;less flexible, and more adapted
to a <i>sostenuto</i> or declamatory style. Mezzo-soprano voices
vary so much that it is difficult to name any note on which
the "break" will be found. Sometimes it is on the same
notes as a soprano&mdash;sometimes on the same as a contralto&mdash;on
the average, perhaps, nearer the former. Wherever
it may be, however, a judicious teacher will soon point
it out, and put the student into the way of rightly treating
it. Teaching, and <i>good</i> teaching, is especially necessary
for voices of this class, for their fortunate possessors are
generally ignorant of the value of the treasure which they
possess in a good mezzo-soprano; and if it be of light
quality, they fancy themselves soprani, and force the upper
register of the voice in trying to "stretch their compass;"
or if their low notes develop first, they think that "with
practice" they are to be contralti; and by over-exercise
and fondness for displaying those deep notes, they run the
risk of widening the break, and rendering the quality of
the whole voice hopelessly uneven.</p>

<p>What lies within the sphere of a good mezzo-soprano
has been shown in late years by a Grisi and a Tietjens,
the latter of whom will live in the recollection of all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
ever heard her, as the perfect model for every mezzo-soprano
in the production of the pure tone and even quality.</p>


<p><b>Mezzo-Contralto.</b>&mdash;The name mezzo-contralto
speaks for itself. It is by no means an uncommon voice,
and if used with discrimination is an effective and useful
one. Both in compass and quality it lies between the
contralto and the mezzo-soprano. Heavier in tone, less
resonant, and less flexible than the mezzo-soprano, it is
yet lighter than the contralto. Pure contralto voices are so
rare that many mezzo-contralto singers appear as exponents
of contralto music, and by paying chief attention to the
lower register of their voices, they become fair imitations,
and more than passable substitutes, for the real article.
The possessor of this voice must be guided by the advice
of a good teacher as to the direction in which her voice
should be trained. Sometimes the natural quality of the
voice renders it advisable to attempt rivalry with the mezzo-soprano,
rather than with the contralto; sometimes the reverse.
It is a question for decision by a competent adviser
in each individual case, and therefore I shall not attempt
to lay down any decided rule, except my oft-repeated one,
"<span class="smcap">Go to a master, and a first rate-one</span>,"&mdash;a point on
which I shall have more to say further on. How impossible
it is to lay down rules for a mezzo-contralto is shown by
the fact that an eminent living "mezzo-contralto" is gladly
accepted on our opera stage as a leading contralto, and
yet succeeds admirably in such a part as Rossini wrote for
a mezzo-soprano of the most florid kind&mdash;<i>Rosina</i> in "<i>Il
Barbiere</i>."</p>


<p><b>Contralto.</b>&mdash;The quality of a true contralto voice is
so peculiar that it is impossible to mistake it for any other
voice, although other voices may be mistaken for it. Of
course, there are exceptional cases in which the contralto
and mezzo-contralto are combined in one voice: the lower
range being of full and pure contralto quality, while instead
of the somewhat limited upper notes of the contralto,
a rich mezzo-contralto range of notes may develop
themselves; and in such a case careful training will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
able to soften these two into each other, so that a complete
voice of peculiar charm and great usefulness will result.
But such cases, if not rare, are certainly the exception
and not the rule, the deep and powerfully resonant tone
of the true contralto being comparatively seldom met
with. There is generally an awkward break between the
low B and the D above it in this voice, and E<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span> or E are
the highest notes within reach of the average contralto.
Voices of this class are better adapted for a species of
ballads, for solemn declamation, or music of a calm and
flowing character, than for elaborate execution or lively
melodies. But here again exceptions must be made in
favour of those who have the physical means, as well as
the artistic skill, to study such music as that of the <i>Page</i>
in "<i>Les Huguenots</i>," <i>Arsace</i> in "<i>Semiramide</i>," or "<i>La
Cenerentola</i>." For an average English contralto, however,
the best line of study is in good songs and ballads, and,
chief of all, oratorio music.</p>


<p><b>Alto.</b>&mdash;The alto, or counter-tenor voice, is said by a
well-known English alto singer to be "simply a development
of the <i>falsetto</i>&mdash;generally the <i>falsetto</i> of an inferior
bass voice." It is said to be almost peculiar to English
singers, and to that fact is ascribed its extensive and
effective use in the fine works of the English Cathedral
School of composers. Of course, in a voice which is so
artificial, there must be expected a worse "break" than
usual&mdash;the break in this case being the point below which
the falsetto cannot be extended, and where the natural
"chest" quality of tone has to be used. This break
generally lies near the same place as the contralto break&mdash;if
anything, rather higher&mdash;say between C and E in
the middle of the voice. The effective notes of an alto
usually lie in the octave of B or B<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, and the repertoire
of music for which this voice is suited is comparatively
limited. That repertoire, however, includes the greater
number of oratorios, a good deal of fine old Italian music,
and a few old English songs; while a singer of cleverness
and cultivation will find many ballads which he may make
his own by the help of transposition and style of delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Great pains must be taken by the possessor of an alto
voice in the formation and production of a good tone.
The voice must be made to sound as <i>natural</i> as possible;
and, if necessary, power must unhesitatingly be sacrificed
to sweetness. There is great danger of producing a
harsh, reedy, or nasal tone, which, to the hearer, is simply
distressing or offensive.</p>

<p>Above all, let him be content to develop his own means,
and to keep to music suited to or written for his voice. A
good alto will make no effect, and will do his voice and
style harm, if he "poaches on the preserves" of other
voices&mdash;tenors, for instance, or basses&mdash;(singing the songs
of the latter an octave higher). I once heard an alto&mdash;a
fair singer so long as he stuck to his own work&mdash;make an
absurd exhibition of himself by attempting the great song
"Love Sounds the Alarm," in "<i>Acis and Galatea</i>," at a
public concert!</p>

<p>Let him also beware of the snare of contralto music.
The alto in a man is totally distinct from the contralto in
a woman. The tone is utterly different&mdash;the best notes of
the one are certainly not the best notes of the other; and
although in certain cases a contralto may sing with good
effect music written for a male alto (<i>e.g.</i> in some oratorios),
yet the converse is scarcely ever true. The low notes,
which are so fine in a contralto, and so unlike any other
tone except perhaps a few notes of some tenors, are utterly
wanting in charm, and generally in power, in a male alto;
while the sweet and ringing middle notes of the latter are
far more effective in alto music than the (frequently) weak
and uncertain middle notes of a contralto. Choose your
music as you name your voice, by the quality of tone you
can produce, and not by the range of notes.</p>


<p><b>Tenore-Leggiero.</b>&mdash;The <i>tenore-leggiero</i> or "light
tenor," is the male voice corresponding to the female
soprano; it is perhaps the most delicate and difficult to
manage of all human voices. In the present day, when
fashion is all in favour of noise, it is difficult for any but
the strong-minded to stand firm against the tendency to
shout and bawl, which appears to be the highest aim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
many singers, and the highest admiration of most audiences.
Now for a light tenor to attempt this style of
singing is simply suggestive of the old fable of the frog
who tried to make himself as big as the bull, and burst
in the attempt. There is a modern school of singing
which, though it may be suitable enough for heavy voices
such as basses and robust tenors, is fatal to light and
delicate voices. The style of singing, and of music to be
sung, by this voice, is quite different from that appropriate
to strong and full organs; and, if you are the possessor
of a light tenor, you must at once rid yourself of the
common amateur fancy (a fancy, too, by no means confined
to amateurs) that you must imitate a certain ever-popular
living tenor, whose name has passed almost into
a proverb as typical of the perfection of English singing.
You <i>cannot</i> be a "Reeves" or a "Braham," therefore it
is only waste of time and strength for you to try. But
there is a great deal of music which neither a "Reeves"
nor a "Braham" could sing, which is well within your
reach; and more than that, there is a great deal of
excellent music which, though you cannot sing it <i>like</i>
them, you may render very effective in a totally different
style. Very often a <i>pianissimo</i> is quite as expressive as a
<i>fortissimo</i>, and grace and sweetness are frequently an
excellent substitute for power and force. You must be
content to recognize that the latter are out of your reach,
and that the effects which you can produce are to be
attained by other means.</p>

<p>However, while assuring you that power and force are
not given to you, I do not mean to say that voices of your
class need be at all inaudible in a space however large.
The tone of a light tenor is generally clear, resonant, and
penetrating; sometimes there is a metallic ring about it
which is extremely pretty, if not forced. I have heard a
light tenor, singing at the back of the Covent Garden
stage, send his voice clearly out into the great theatre,
with apparently more ease than his "robust" friend, who
was shortly afterwards vociferating at the footlights.</p>

<p>A light tenor must be careful not to force up the lower
register of his voice beyond its natural and easy limit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The charm of the voice is in the perfect blending together
of the lower, middle, and upper registers, and to do this
the upper notes of each register should be equally at
command, as the upper notes of that register or the lower
notes of the one above it. In order to attain this, the
change from one register to another should generally be
made considerably lower than the place where the real
"break" in the voice comes. For instance, supposing
the "break" to be on E<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, the singer should be able to
change his register as low as B or B<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, and to take all the
notes between those two places, either in the upper or
lower register, with equal effect.</p>

<p>In voices of this character there is often one note
which requires to be <i>made</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, which is so naturally
defective in tone and quality that it can only be produced
effectively by imitating as nearly as possible the quality of
the register above or below it. This note is generally E,
F, F&#x266f;, or (sometimes) G, between the middle and upper
registers; and if you find that you unfortunately have
such a refractory note, remember not to try and force the
tone of it from the next note above or below; <i>e.g.</i>, if your
bad note is F, do not try to improve it by singing E well
and then passing on to the F; but try and form the note
from the fifth above or below (whichever it happens to
resemble most in tone). Rounden the refractory note&mdash;give
it a full tone in practising, and produce it well from
the chest, letting the sound reverberate from the centre of
the roof of the mouth&mdash;neither too far back towards the
throat, nor too much on the teeth. Your teacher, if he
knows his business, will soon put you into the way of
this. Voices vary so much that these very general remarks
must suffice here; but each voice, if it has its peculiar
difficulties, has also, doubtless, its peculiar charm;
and for light tenors, rich in both charms and difficulties,
the rule is all-important: Do not try to imitate anybody
else, but let your aim be to do the best that can be done
with such natural gifts as you may have, aided by the
best training that you can procure for them.</p>


<p><b>Tenore-Robusto.</b>&mdash;The robust or strong tenor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the male voice corresponding to the mezzo-soprano of a
female. It is not an uncommon voice, but is rarely met
with in anything like perfection. A robust tenor voice
of large compass and round full tone is a treasure of the
utmost value. The fact is, that too frequently the possessor
of a good voice of this kind, instead of taking care
of it and training it for the future, begins using it too soon,
strains and forces it into coarseness, and spoils it for ever.
People do not realize that a voice may be strong in quality
and powerful in tone, and yet in itself be an excessively
delicate thing to keep in order.</p>

<p>Moreover, voices of this kind in their youth frequently
resemble barytones, and their owners, fired with ambition
to rival some popular barytone singer, mistake their vocation,
and shout and bellow on the very part of the voice&mdash;the
upper "chest" register&mdash;which requires the tenderest
nursing to fit it for future difficulties. Consequently,
when the voice develops with age, and the singer finds
that barytone work is too heavy for the lower part of the
voice, and that he can without much difficulty extend his
compass beyond the barytone limits, he discovers that
what he has been using as the top of his voice is nearer
the middle of it, and that the mode of using those notes
which he has practised is excessively difficult, if not impossible,
with those which now lie above them. The result
is either the creation of a very awkward "break," which
even time and practice can never entirely remove, or else
(and this is a commoner case) the same process of forcing
which has been employed hitherto is applied to the upper
notes, as far as strength can take it! This is the reason
why so many tenor singers are utterly unable to produce
the real tenor "tone," and sound like barytones forced up
to a higher compass. There is no sweetness in the upper
notes so produced&mdash;nothing but force and noise; while
the hapless perpetrator of the howls which represent high
notes turns scarlet in the face, and quivers all over with
his exertions. I therefore give to tenors of this class exactly
the same warning that I gave to soprani:&mdash;Do not
ignore the fact that you have three, or at all events two,
distinct registers of the voice, the (so-called) "chest,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"throat," and "head." Do not suppose, when you hear
a great singer produce on a high note exactly the same
quality of tone as he produced on a low one, that he did
it exactly the same way, or "got it from the same place,"
as some people say. The perfection of his training and
the diligence of his practice have enabled him to assimilate
the quality of one register to that of another so completely
as to deceive your ear. The proof that this is true
may be found in inspecting a great deal of music written
for and sung by the most famous operatic tenors of the
past&mdash;the singers of that pure Italian school of which so
few disciples now remain.</p>

<p>There are notes and passages in that music which no
"chest" register could by any physical possibility execute,
but some of which have been sung within the recollection
even of the "rising generation" with all the effect intended,
and with the very tone that critical slang calls "chest
notes," (simply because it so closely resembles the tone
of chest notes that few, if any, can detect that they are
differently produced from the low notes.)</p>

<p>For obvious reasons I abstain from mentioning the
names of any living singers, but I can name one, not very
long since dead, who attained the highest reputation here
as a <i>tenore di forza</i>&mdash;whose "chest notes" were chronicled
by the newspaper critics, and were the envy of aspiring
youths&mdash;and yet who has ever been heard distinctly to
deny that he ever produced those notes in the same way as
the lower ones, and to laugh at the idea that such a thing
was possible; and this was Mongini.</p>

<p>I have entered into this at some length because it is a
point which is more and more ignored by the singers and
teachers of this generation. I might almost say that a
school of singing exists the whole aim of which is to
abolish the natural upper part of the voice, in order to
stretch and force the one lower register up beyond its
natural compass. I do not deny that in certain cases a
voice results from this treatment which is powerful,
effective, and capable of executing a good deal of music
with much success and satisfaction to the performer; but
for one case where this treatment so far succeeds, it fails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in twenty to produce a voice both pleasing and useful; it
is, moreover, in singers trained on this method that we
most commonly hear the odious (and involuntary) trembling
of the upper notes commonly called the <i>vibrato</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore, to sum up those who find, when their voices
begin to form, that the natural quality of their voice is
lighter than that of a bass, had better make up their minds
at once to give the voice fair play, and let it alone for a
time; then consult a good master, or one really experienced
in hearing singers, as to what the future of the
voice is to be. It is by no means easy always to decide
at that early period whether the permanent quality of the
voice will be tenor or barytone, and therefore it is folly
to try and settle the question for yourself by singing, in
untaught style, music which may prove to have been all
along unsuited to you. Your patience in waiting till the
voice really declares itself will amply repay you afterwards
by the absence of the difficulties which too early a use of
the voice would have created for you to overcome.</p>


<p><b>Barytone and Basso-Cantante.</b>&mdash;The barytone
voice is thus described in Stainer and Barrett's "Dictionary
of Musical Terms:" "A voice of fuller quality than a
tenor, and lighter than a bass, having a compass partly
included in both.... This voice has only been
distinguished by name as being of a separate character
within the present century. Early writers indicate its
existence by the use of its special clef. The term barytone
is unmeaning unless it be looked upon as a corruption
of barytenor; but it is quite possible it was borrowed from
the instrument barytone or bardone, which occupied a
place between the tenor and bass viols."</p>

<p>The derivation of the name from "barytenor" is slightly
absurd, considering that half that extraordinary word is
Greek and the other half Latin; whereas the name barytone
is a Greek word, used by Aristotle, and meaning
"deep-sounding."</p>

<p>The distinctive character which this voice has assumed
within the present century is due, I believe, to the great
change in the pitch of musical instruments which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
taken place. In the last century the pitch was so much
lower than that at present in use, that a "high barytone"
was much the same as a "robust tenor." Consequently,
music was not written exclusively for the barytone voice,
its existence as a separate class of voice not being sufficiently
recognized. Gradually, as the pitch was raised,
the barytone separated itself clearly from other voices,
and has now a repertoire of music and a style of singing
of its own; and instead of appropriating tenor music, it,
if anything, has stolen away some of the property of the
bass; for the raising of the pitch which placed tenor
music beyond the reach of a barytone has also rendered
a good deal of music originally written for a bass far more
suitable for a barytone, or at all events for a basso-cantante.
I am well aware that by many musicians the basso-cantante
is identified with the barytone. The distinction is
so slight that it is not worth while to quarrel over names;
but that the two voices are distinct I am persuaded. The
basso-cantante is of fuller and rounder quality than the
barytone proper; less flexible, less metallic in tone, and
generally rather lower in compass. But the method of
using both voices is the same, and for all purposes of
amateur singers no distinction need be insisted upon.
Professionals, however, who have to deal with heavy work
on a large scale, will soon find that there is a good range
of music more suited to the rich voice of greater volume
and less flexibility (which I distinguished as the basso-cantante)
than to the bright, flexible voice which has
something of the tone of a full "tenore-robusto," and
which is the barytone proper. Neither of these voices
is much troubled with a "break," although there is a
perceptible difference between the natural quality of the
lower and upper octaves of the voice when quite uncultivated.
This difference, however, which makes itself felt
<span class="figleft" style="width: 219px;">
<img src="images/043.png" width="219" height="52" alt="F3 G3 A3" title="F3 G3 A3" />
<span class="hide-link"><a href="music/043.mid">[Listen]</a></span>
</span>
in the region of these notes, is got
rid of in practice without any of
the same difficulty which is encountered
by tenors or contralti in managing the decided
breaks in their voices. The possessors of barytone voices
may therefore be looked upon as having comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
"easy times of it." There is a large repertoire of music
at their disposal, including much of the most popular
ballad music of this century and the last; the voice is generally
a favourite with an audience; the style of barytone
singing is undisputed, and the singer will not find himself
violently criticised by the partizans of a rival school of
singing to that in which he himself has been trained, which
is inevitably the fate of tenors!</p>

<p>Only let him avoid the temptation to shout, and to sing
up to the very top of his compass at full pitch. Unfortunately,
an English audience does like a noise, and appreciates
plenty more than beauty of tone. It is tolerably
easy for a barytone to be a showy singer, and therein lies
the greatest danger to his chance of ever being a really
good one. He must be content to go through his training
quite as self-denyingly and perseveringly as any one
else who is gifted with fewer natural advantages.</p>


<p><b>Bass.</b>&mdash;Of the bass voice less need be said here, not
because it is a less important voice than any of the others,
but because it is more generally known and better understood.
A perfectly pure bass voice is, however, a rare
thing. This voice has no upper register, properly speaking;
the whole voice consisting of "chest" notes, and not
admitting of even the process of developing upper notes
of extraordinary quality, which is part of the training of a
barytone or a basso-cantante. Power and richness are the
chief qualities of charm in a bass, while flexibility and true
intonation are the qualities most rarely found in that voice.
The young singer who finds that he certainly is not meant
by nature for a tenor, and also that with all his efforts the
upper notes of a barytone are quite out of his reach, need
not be discouraged by any lightness or thinness of quality
in his voice from the hope that he may develop into a good
bass. The full and rich quality of this voice is later in
showing itself than is the case with any other voice, and
the young singer must be content to study for some time
with the compass of a bass and the quality of a kind of
barytone, till Nature puts him in full possession of his
powers. Only he must study bass music, and not try,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
because his voice is of barytone quality, to sing barytone
music. Let him, on the contrary, avoid trying to extend
the compass of his voice in the upper notes, and give his
best attention to the lower ones. The upper ones will be
well within his command in time, and if he will be content
to let them alone at first, he may become a truly "celebrated
bass;" but, if he persists in shouting at them now, he will
never have anything but coarse upper tones, only fit to be
heard behind a costermonger's barrow, or in "comic"
songs at the Music Halls.</p>


<p><b>Buffo.</b>&mdash;The last remark reminds me that I have said
nothing about a class of bass singers very useful in certain
Italian and French operas&mdash;the <i>buffo</i>, or comic bass.
The development of voice with these singers is of less consequence
than the study of a peculiar style, a good deal
of the point of their songs consisting in the entire elimination
of anything like musical tone from many notes and
passages. A clever and good buffo singer may very likely
be able to sing other music well, but the style is so entirely
dramatic and so utterly out of place anywhere except on
the stage, that no amateur should ever attempt it, and no
professional should appear <i>in a concert-room</i> as the exponent
of such music. Therefore, for those who wish to sing, any
remarks on the peculiarities of a buffo bass would be superfluous;
those who wish to study that line as a profession,
for stage work, must learn all that they need from a regular
dramatic teacher; while those who wish to execute English
"comic" songs, may spare themselves any anxiety as to
their voices: if they have any voice naturally, "comic"
singing will soon destroy its charm, and that will not
matter to them, for the last thing necessary to sing a
"comic" song is the possession of a voice of any kind.
Therefore, if you have a bass (or any other voice, indeed),
avoid "comic" songs, and leave the "buffo" business to
those who can do nothing better.</p>


<p><b>Qualities of Voice, Good and Bad.</b>&mdash;It may not
be unwelcome to the student to have pointed out to him
those qualities of voice which are to be aimed at or cultivated,
and also those which are to be avoided or overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The charms of a voice are found among the following
qualities: clearness, sweetness, evenness, flexibility, power,
extent of compass, variety, brilliancy, firmness, persuasiveness.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the opposite side must be ranked roughness, huskiness,
feebleness (or want of power), shrillness (or want of
depth), hardness and want of flexibility, dulness, or want
of "ring," &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible for any one voice to unite in
itself all these merits or all these defects; and you cannot
give yourself merits which Nature has withheld; but you
may marvellously improve what natural merits you have,
and do wonders in overcoming any difficulties which
Nature has placed in your way.</p>

<h2><a name="INSTRUCTION" id="INSTRUCTION">ON INSTRUCTION, MASTERS, AND
"SINGING TUTORS."</a></h2>


<p>The voice, and how to use it, is a subject which has troubled
many minds, and no doubt this will continue to be the
case; but the difficult problem will not be solved by running
to pettifogging teachers, who advertise to teach all
that is known of singing, and a little more, in twelve easy
lessons, without previous knowledge or practice at home,
for the small fee of one guinea! Let it be stated once
for all: singing cannot be taught in twelve easy lessons,
and can scarcely be acquired in one hundred very severe
lessons. Therefore distrust at once any one who holds
out so tempting a bait to you; remember that there is no
"royal road" to singing, any more than there is to the
acquirement of any other art; and the person who tells
you that he can teach you to do without trouble that which
costs great artists the study of a lifetime, proclaims himself,
<i>ipso facto</i>, to be a humbug.</p>


<p><b>Schools of Singing.</b>&mdash;There are several so-called
Schools of Singing. There is a French School, which for
any language but French is bad, and which very seldom
turns out a pleasing singer. There is a German School,
which is worse, being simply the production of coarse noise.
Some people say that there is an English School. I hope
there may be some day, but at present its existence is
rather doubtful, unless those who talk of an English school
of singing mean the Cathedral style&mdash;which for solo work
is detestable&mdash;or the old school of Oratorio singing, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
its Handelian traditions, which was not an English, but
an Italian, and the best Italian, school.</p>

<p>In fact, there is but one school of singing in the world,
and that is the Italian. Whatever language you wish to
sing in, whatever style of music you wish to study principally,
you must train your voice, produce it, and learn to
use it in the Italian method, if you hope ever to deserve
the name of a singer.</p>


<p><b>Masters.</b>&mdash;Of course, in a work of this sort, it is impossible,
and would be wrong if it were possible, to mention
the names of living teachers: therefore I can only
give general hints. If possible, study only under a master
whom you know to have lived in Italy, and to have studied
there for some years under some good master or in some
good Conservatoire&mdash;Naples, Milan, and Florence generally
supply the best. Possibly, for an English singer, an
English master <i>who fulfils these conditions</i> may be better
than even an Italian, as he should understand better the
peculiarities of English voices and temperaments, and
would know at once where the chief difficulties would lie.
Let me, however, correct a popular error. A good singer
is not necessarily a good teacher, nor is it necessary for
a first-class teacher to be able to sing at all. Nor need
you necessarily look for your master among foreigners
with fine sounding names. There are two or three good
teachers of singing in this country who are foreigners;
but there is also some native talent equally capable of
teaching singing, as it is accepted in this country at the
present time. These know the English style better than
any foreigner can teach it, and after all, style is the chief
consideration.</p>


<p><b>Institutions.</b>&mdash;As we have no real English School of
singing, it is perhaps fortunate that we have no Conservatoire.
There are, however, Institutions accessible to those
who cannot afford to have masters at home or to place
themselves under a private teacher. Of these, the chief
is the Royal Academy of Music, in Tenterden Street,
Hanover Square. There is also the National Training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
School of Music, the London Academy of Music, also the
Guildhall School, and there is Trinity College, London,
where I believe singing lessons may also be obtained. To
all these establishments singing masters, more or less
good, are attached, and it is open to any one to obtain
admission to the concerts given from time to time at the
institutions themselves, and to form some kind of opinion
as to the teachers from the performances of the pupils. It
would be well for an intending student to do this, for of
course at any institution where there are several professors,
one might suit you and another might not; it is even conceivable
that one professor might do all for you that you
could possibly require, while another professor might be
an ignorant charlatan. Therefore, hear their pupils and
judge for yourself, making inquiries at the same time of
musical people who are qualified to express an opinion
on singing. I must not, however, withhold from my
readers my conviction that private lessons are better and
more effectual than those taken in schools and academies.
The terms at these public institutions are such that they
preclude the possibility of more than twenty or thirty
minutes being devoted to each pupil, and that is <i>not</i> a
sufficient time to bestow upon a lesson. Forty-five or
sixty minutes are needed to give a good lesson; and the
pupil who pays fifteen shillings or a guinea for this, does
a wiser thing than the one who pays a fourth of that sum
for, say, twenty minutes' attention.</p>

<p><b>A First Opinion.</b>&mdash;The actual successful teachers of
singing in London may be counted on the fingers of one
hand, and those who are qualified to teach singing, but who
are not specially successful, may be found on the remaining
five fingers. Each of these professors would probably
not take less than one guinea the lesson, and it would,
honestly, be far cheaper in the long run to pay this sum
for one good lesson in singing than it would be to have
fifty lessons founded upon wrong principles, even for nothing.
And for this reason: teachers of this calibre will
not trouble themselves about you or your guineas unless
you have a promising voice, some general musical talent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and show signs of becoming, to some degree, a credit to
your <i>teacher</i>, for to these men guinea pupils are very plentiful,
and it is only reasonable that a guinea from a clever
pupil should be worth considerably more to a sensitive
artist than the same amount from a fool. Therefore, a
first opinion from one such teacher may save your spending
money, time, and energy on a pursuit in which you
can never succeed.</p>


<p><b>Bad Lessons.</b>&mdash;Never take a bad singing lesson till
you know how to sing. You may then do so (if you care
to), and learn the "how not to do it" of singing. It is
commonly supposed that the earliest singing lessons may
be administered by any "dabbler," and the last touches
given afterwards by a "finishing master." Never was there
a greater error. Pay your guineas first, and your shillings
afterwards. If you cannot afford to have good instruction
in beginning to sing, you will be still less able to take it
afterwards, for artistic reasons. Remember that every bad
singing lesson which you take hardens old faults and
creates new ones, and, moreover, takes you farther and
farther away from your original starting-point. So, when
you begin under the right man and the right method, you
have to <i>undo</i> all this that you have expended toil and
money to acquire.</p>


<p><b>Bad Teachers.</b>&mdash;It is astonishing how much money
is wasted by people who want to sing, through not going
at once to the fountain-head for the necessary training.
Because a man is a musician many people conclude that
he must necessarily be able to teach singing! Such an
idea is scarcely less monstrous than that of a man being a
good physician and consequently competent to amputate
a limb, or to take out and reset an eye. Do not follow this
"multitude to do evil." Be as careful in inquiring about
your singing master as you would be about your doctor.
Both in London and in the country there are "professors"
whose knowledge of singing stops at professing&mdash;the class
of people who (very likely) keep a music-shop, tune your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
piano, play polkas and waltzes for your evening parties,
and have a brass plate on their doors to this effect:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="15" summary="Brass Plate">
  <tr>
    <td class="center">
      <span class="smcap big">Mr. Handel Moscheles Ignazio Jones,<br />
      professor of the pianoforte, harmony,<br />
      the violin, italian, and singing.</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All honourable professions, no doubt; but to profess to
combine them all is dishonourable, and insulting to the
common sense of those who know anything of any one of
the subjects professed. A singing master, if he is worth
anything, must be a man of one trade&mdash;singing. For the
teaching of singing is a "specialty," and the man who can
teach it <i>properly</i> is not likely to be a man of all (musical)
work.</p>


<p><b>Books of Exercises, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;There are numerous
"Singing Tutors" published, giving rules, exercises, <i>solfeggi</i>,
&amp;c. Many of these are excellent, and some nearly
perfect. But all alike are useless or worse than useless to
the tyro, without a master. You might as well suppose
that a child could learn to be a carpenter by having some
fine wood and a box of good tools.</p>

<p>I have before observed that voices vary as faces do; no
two are exactly alike, each voice having its peculiar merit
and its peculiar defect. Now, a good master will treat
each voice on its own merit, and not place it at first on
the Procrustean bed of a book of rules and exercises. He
will probably write down his own exercises expressly for
his pupil, and if not that, he will select certain exercises
from the book, and forbid others to be attempted for a
time. You must also let your master select such a book
for you, so that you may have one in which the rules do
not contradict those which he has already given you
verbally, or else you will be perplexed with a multitude
of counsellors.</p>

<p>It is not till a certain stage in singing has been reached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
under the training of a master, that any book of exercises
can be of service to you. When that stage is reached, you
will find such a work of great use in a part of your labours.
Among such books may be named as especially good,&mdash;Concone's
Exercises, Righini's, Guercia's, Nava's,
Lablache's, and Lamperti's; but, again I say, do not
choose for yourself. There are some excellent rules, as
well as some good exercises, in an old work of the kind
by Crivelli, and also in "Singing Exemplified," a work
by T. Cooke. If you can meet with these, secure them&mdash;although
I fear they may be long since out of print&mdash;for
in the literature of singing the <i>new</i> is by no means
certain to excel what was written in the days of our best
composers and singers of operas and oratorios.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_PRACTICE_OF_SINGING" id="ON_THE_PRACTICE_OF_SINGING">ON THE PRACTICE OF SINGING.</a></h2>


<p>Remember that the voice is of all instruments the most
difficult one to study, and to bring perfectly under control,
especially for the first year or two. Do not attempt to
cultivate it with the view to professional remuneration,
unless you can set apart at least two hours daily for most
careful study, and can also afford to wait at least eight or
ten years for any <i>substantial</i> pecuniary reward for your
labours.</p>


<p><b>Individuality.</b>&mdash;It is of great importance to bear in
mind that no two voices are exactly alike. To some
singers is given quality of voice, to others quantity. And
for each alike, steady, well-aimed, and well-ordered practice
is indispensable. But, whatever you sing ought, like your
voice, to have some touch of individuality: the song should
seem to come naturally from you, and to be the spontaneous
expression of your thoughts. At the same time
you must not lose sight of the all-important guide which
you have in the composer's intentions and wishes. Remember
that a small and delicate voice may be made to
go as far as, if not farther than, a voice of large volume
and long compass. By judicious management, by touching
expression of the softer feelings, by careful selection of
music to be performed, the obstacles which are placed in
a singer's way by want of power may be effectually removed,
because the audience will irresistibly feel the
influence of the singer's individuality. The difficulties of
the singer who has the gift of quantity rather than quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of voice, are in some respects greater, because the necessity
for thus impressing on his audience a sense of his own
individuality is not so strongly forced on him by circumstances.
Not only has he to labour to attain a good quality
of tone, but he must also resist the temptation to fancy
that "might is right," and that the "sensation" caused by
a powerful voice is all that he need aim at. And here let
me say, the way to get quality is to listen as often as
possible to some leading singer of your own kind of voice.
Try and imitate his tone; but above all practise with a
medium tone&mdash;a <i>mezzo-voce</i>&mdash;listen for the beauty in your
tone, and think of what you are doing when practising.</p>


<p><b>Perseverance.</b>&mdash;The surest means of improving and
strengthening the voice is by constantly exercising and
practising it. Just as the muscles and fibres of the legs
of a pedestrian are increased and made capable of great
exertion by careful training, so is it with the nerves and
muscles of the throat. With judicious training, the compass
of the voice is extended, its quality is improved, its
tones grow rounder and firmer; and, if the master is a
good one, and the pupil is willing to study patiently for
some time, never resting content, but always aiming at
further progress as year succeeds year, he may not unreasonably
hope to attain a well-earned place in his profession,
and its attendant reward.</p>


<p><b>Facial Expression.</b>&mdash;A looking-glass should form a
part of the furniture of a singing student's study, for it is
most important to watch the face&mdash;its features and expressions&mdash;when
singing; and it is none the less useful for
insuring the constant right position of the mouth. In
respect to the facial expression when singing, there is a
very great tendency to look too serious, too severe, and
too hard when earnestly studying. Now, a cheerful and
good-humoured expression does not necessarily imply
carelessness, and it is far more agreeable to the audience
than an anxious and troubled look. Some people look
quite savage when singing; and when rendering passages
of love and tenderness, their features are far more indicative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of rage, revenge, and murder! And this very common
fault is generally quite an unconscious habit. It is only
to be remedied by constant care, and to this end practice
before a looking-glass will be found very helpful.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Body.</b>&mdash;How to stand when
singing has been explained by a great number of writers
on the subject, and most of the explanations given have
been chiefly remarkable as being entirely erroneous and
false. The body should not be kept in a perfectly upright
position, as it is (too popularly) believed that it should.
The best position is when the body is well collected,
with its chief weight upon the right leg and foot, with
the head gently leaning forward, and the arms and, indeed,
the whole carriage disposed in that manner which would
indicate to the audience a sort of desire on your part to
<i>persuade</i> them and bring them over to your feelings and
sentiments. When the right leg begins to tire with the
weight of the body, the left leg can take its duty, when
the right may be gracefully drawn back as in dancing.
The best lesson on this subject, however, can be gleaned
by carefully watching the <i>pose</i> of a good Italian singer
during singing.</p>


<p><b>Self-Accompaniment.</b>&mdash;A sitting position is a very
bad one in which to practise. All singing should be done
in a standing position, and the student is strongly urged
to adhere to this rule. Instead of sitting at the pianoforte,
and accompanying an exercise or "solfeggio," it is
far better to sound the first note of each passage therein,
and master the same without any accompaniment. The
advantages of this mode of practising must be obvious;
but one of the most important is, that the attention is not
divided between the pianoforte and the voice, while it
leaves the singer free to give all his attention and care to
the <i>production</i> of the notes which he is endeavouring to
sing artistically.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Arms.</b>&mdash;I would urge upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
student to hold a piece of music in his hands while he
practises. There is a place for the hands when singing
in public; but this place is neither the trouser-pockets,
nor on the hips, nor behind the back, nor across the
chest, but rather that position which is secured by
<i>leisurely</i> holding the music-sheet, not as if actually singing
therefrom, but as though it were merely intended for
reference, if required. This easy attitude not only gives
the hands and arms their legitimate position, but also
lends a grace and freedom to other parts of the body, all
which points must be attended to in singing. Remember
to keep the arms well away from the body. Some singers
stick the elbows into the waist, as though to give support;
instead of doing which, they hinder the free action of the
lungs, besides giving an awkward look to the whole figure.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Hands.</b>&mdash;Do not let your hands
hang down, but keep them well before you, in some position
which allows of your turning the palms uppermost. In
this way you (as it were) lock the joints of the shoulders,
and put a check on the tendency to raise the shoulders,
which is an invariable consequence of taking breath
wrongly. Keep your shoulders well back, your elbows
depressed, and your hands with the palms uppermost, and
you will find it difficult, if not impossible, to indulge in
the vice of heaving the chest and shoulders up and down,
like the piston of a steam-engine!</p>


<p><b>Position of the Throat.</b>&mdash;One of the first conditions
of singing well is to keep the throat open. To have
the throat in its proper position the tongue must be kept
down, and hollowed like the bowl of a spoon, its root being
well depressed. Nor must the throat ever be allowed to
screw itself up small, a common failing of many singers
whenever they approach a high note. Most of my readers
have yawned once or twice in their lives: if they will do
it once more, in front of their looking-glass, and watch the
inside of the mouth as they yawn, they will see and feel
the exact position in which the throat should be during
good singing. It will be useful to repeat this proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
until the mind is thoroughly impressed and the memory
familiarized with the feeling of the mouth and throat in
this, the correct position for singing.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Throat, &amp;c., in Soft Singing.</b>&mdash;When
singing softly, or <i>piano</i>, as it is called, take great
pains to keep your throat as open as you would for singing
loudly, leaving it entirely to the mouth and lips to
keep the tone soft, yet steady and firm. Do not forget,
too, that in soft singing it is a great advantage to keep the
mouth in a smiling position.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Tongue.</b>&mdash;The tongue, while being
so useful, is nevertheless a very unruly member in singing.
It has so great a tendency to get out of its place. Its legitimate
office is to rest quite flat, or even hollow, in the
bottom of the mouth, with its root well down, as this keeps
the throat-passage clear, and with the tip of it just touching
the lower teeth. Get a looking-glass, and continually
watch the position of the tongue. Never allow it to roll
up or turn about when singing, or the effect produced
will be scarcely worth repeating. The tongue should
occupy the least possible space in the mouth, and this is
the case when the directions here given are carried out.</p>


<p><b>Position of the Larynx.</b>&mdash;The larynx, or upper part
of the wind-pipe, plays a most important part in singing.
Upon it depends all the beauty, and quality, and richness
of the voice. The singer will do well to constantly think
about the larynx, to watch it, to feel that it is well down
below the mouth before commencing the first note of a
song, which note must, under such circumstances, be rich,
round, and penetrating. Then the larynx must never be
allowed to rise above this fixed point. It may be deepened,
and must be, for the higher notes, but it must never ascend,
or nearly approach the roof of the mouth, or the sound-passage
is closed, and the sounds become at once impure,
vitiated, and without body or foundation.</p>

<p>Try and guard against the bad habit of pushing forward
the chin when singing, otherwise the tone cannot fail to
be faulty. The chin should be well down on the chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and the larynx quite low, to lead to an easy and pure production
of tone. To be constantly moving both the jaws
for every note, continually displaces the larynx, impairs
the purity of the tone, spoils the articulation of the words,
and, what is worse than all, produces a hideous expression
of the features, which latter fault would alone be sufficient
to prejudice seriously the chances of any singing artists.
The lower parts of the jaws, not the upper ones, should
do the work; and when a high passage or note is before
the singer, the lower parts of the jaws should be exercised
to drop as the notes increase in height. The singer's face
should be controlled, if no other member can be so regulated.</p>


<p><b>Singing in the Head.</b>&mdash;There is, in all beginners,
a tendency to sing too much in the head, that is, to have
the foundation of the tones too high up in the throat.
This fault is due to the difficulty experienced by beginners
in keeping the larynx sufficiently below the mouth. The
fulness of tone, the rich, round, and mellow quality which
is so much admired in all good singers, is almost entirely
owing to the voice being pitched low down, and not high
up in the throat, towards the back of the head (as it <i>appears</i>
to be).</p>

<p>A few trials of this will soon convince the student of
the vast difference in the character and <i>timbre</i> of the tones
of these two ways, and also of the economy of the plan
here recommended, so far as regards the wear and tear
of the voice in practice.</p>


<p><b>Throatiness.</b>&mdash;Throatiness, or singing in the throat,
is the common enemy of all English singers. Our language
is the chief cause of this disagreeable habit, which
we begin to acquire as soon as we learn to talk. Still, by
diligence, the evil can be cured, and no better plan can
be followed than to constantly practise singing the vowel-sounds
Ah, A, E, O, throughout the compass of the voice,
taking every possible care&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;never
to allow the <i>tone</i> to vary, nor to leave the teeth, and not
to screw up the throat, especially in high notes. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
impossible to produce a "throaty" quality of voice if the
throat is well open, and the tone is firmly directed, and
kept on the upper teeth and front of the mouth. On the
other hand, if the student screws up the throat, rolls the
tongue, or practises singing without being constantly on
the look-out for the "voice on the teeth," the result must
be a "throatiness," which is most disagreeable to all people
who have any real knowledge of what singing should be.</p>


<p><b>Clearing the Throat.</b>&mdash;Singers, good and bad, are
often troubled with an apparent stoppage in the throat,
and this inconvenience seems to be at its worst just at
that moment when they wish to sing. To displace or to
cure this stoppage, they begin hacking and coughing
("clearing the throat" as it is called), which proceeding,
however, only makes bad worse for the time being, and
finally grows into a habit, till at last such people cannot
venture to open their mouths without first subjecting the
throat to a series of these irritating "hacks." A good
master will soon cure this complaint by refusing to continue
the lesson whenever the pupil gives way to the bad
habit. It is in many cases simply a nervous trick, and if the
singer will accustom himself to <i>swallow</i> instead of coughing,
whenever he feels the sensation of which we are
speaking, he will soon get rid of it. If it results in any
case from real weakness of the throat, it may be beneficial
to gargle three or four times a day with moderately strong
salt and water, especially before singing. This does no
harm to the voice, and by bracing and strengthening the
muscles of the throat renders them more obedient to the
singer's will.</p>


<p><b>High Notes.</b>&mdash;Many people find great difficulty in
counting, with any degree of certainty, upon the top notes
of their register. I know of no greater assistance towards
bringing these out than that of well contracting the mouth
and lips at the beginning of the passage in which these
high notes occur, dropping the lower jaws, and securing
a good play of the mouth as the highest note is reached,
at the same time keeping the throat as open as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
ejecting the sound to the audience with as much "lip-force"
as can be secured, being careful that the tone is safe "on
the teeth" before the note is "opened."</p>


<p><b>The Scale.</b>&mdash;There can be no doubt whatever that
the grand groundwork of all singing is the diatonic scale.
On it is built all the graceful forms and figures which belong
to the great artist. Yet how few seem to know and
to appreciate this fact! To excel, the diatonic scale must
be practised most seriously and assiduously in its plain
and simple form; nor must it be left until the student
can sing every note therein purely, without wavering or
flutter, and with precision, in the soft, medium, and loud
voices.</p>


<p><b>Forte, Mezzo-Voce, and Piano.</b>&mdash;The singer will
derive much advantage by bearing in mind that the voice
has three main gradations which the Italians class as the
<i>forte</i>, the <i>mezzo di voce</i>, and the <i>piano</i>. The management
of these three is of vital importance, and the singer should
certainly practise the scales in all three voices, and have
each at command for every exercise and passage which
he studies.</p>


<p><b>Tone.</b>&mdash;The tone of the voice must never be vitiated
or rendered impure from any cause whatever. There is
always a danger of this in passages of great energy and
passion, but it should be remembered that whatever be the
effect aimed at, it cannot be attained by any means which
involves a change in the tone of the voice. The first and
chief consideration must always be to produce a good tone
in the right manner. If the tone be not good, the singing
cannot be agreeable; and if it be not produced in the
right manner, you have no security that it will be equally
good throughout the voice, or in passages of all kinds.</p>


<p><b>Chest, Falsetto, and Head Voice.</b>&mdash;I have already
said that there is a good deal of confusion existing
as to the use of the terms "chest," "falsetto," and "head
voice." And this is scarcely to be wondered at, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
that nobody has yet decided <i>how</i> the three qualities of
sound are produced, while everybody knows that the names
are so far misleading, in that no sound whatever is really
made in the <i>chest</i> or in the <i>head</i>, but that all are due to the
passage of air through the larynx, in which are placed the
vocal cords upon which the air plays. The changes of
sound which are spoken of as "chest," "falsetto," and
"head" voices are due to changes in the position of the
larynx and its surroundings, and in the action of the vocal
cords. What those changes are, and how or why they
cause the results which we hear, has yet to be discovered:
there are several theories, but no one has yet ventured to
claim the certainty of truth for any one of them. There
is an excellent article on "The Larynx" in Stainer and
Barrett's "Dictionary of Musical Terms," to which I would
refer those who wish to understand these various theories.
For my present purpose it is sufficient to point out that
each of the names is an utter misnomer. The "chest"
voice is probably so called because the vibrations of the
notes in that register may be distinctly felt in the chest;
and because the breath passes directly from the chest, as it
seems, without any opposition in the throat, producing the
sound on its way. The "falsetto," or range of notes above
the chest, is so called (and rightly so) because in that register
of voice the tone <i>feigns</i>, or imitates, the tone of the
"chest" notes below, although it is certain that the sounds
are not produced in the same way, for the position of the
vocal cords and their attendant parts is different, and
changes suddenly on the passage of the voice from the
chest to the upper register. A falsetto, rightly trained
and used, is one, therefore, which is true to its name, and
so well imitates the "chest," that the hearer cannot distinguish
the "false" from the real "chest tone." The
"head voice," which many people persist in confusing with
the falsetto, is so called because to the singer it feels as
though the notes so produced came from the head. This
is due to the larynx itself rising up in the throat and approaching
the back of the head. It comprises, in reality,
<i>all</i> that part of the voice which lies above the "chest"
register, all the lower part of it being shared by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
"falsetto," exactly as the falsetto shares the greater part of
the chest register. The falsetto, therefore, belongs to both,
and its use is to carry, by its power of imitation, the tone
of the lower or chest register into the upper or head
register, so combining them that no audible change of
quality, or "break," is perceptible.</p>


<p><b>Scale Practice.</b>&mdash;It cannot be too strongly impressed
upon, or too frequently pointed out to, the singer (no
matter what may be the stage of his or her artistic development)
how desirable and advantageous it is to be constantly
singing exercises and solfeggi in preference to songs.
It is a popular fallacy, especially among amateurs, that
the practice of scales and intervals should be left behind
as soon as possible. Pray do not be mistaken. The never-failing
daily practice of singing open chords in solfeggi,
scales, and exercises, is fraught with advantages which
cannot be gained by the study of yards, or even miles, of
song tunes. As an instance of how much may be done in
the study of scale practice, the writer would point out that
this particular exercise should not be left until the student
can sing the diatonic scales throughout the whole extent of
the voice in one unbroken breath, and with one quality,
character, and volume of voice. When this point has been
reached, its peculiar efficacy will be so apparent as not to
require any recommendation or advice for its daily continuance.</p>


<p><b>First Exercises.</b>&mdash;This is a book of advice, not of
exercises, nor do I profess to teach you, but only to point
out to you, how you must prepare to be taught. I cannot
too often repeat that no book by itself can teach you singing,
and my object is not to supersede a master, but to induce
you to place yourself under a good one. However,
it may happen that circumstances of time, place, or pocket
prevent your doing so as soon as you would wish, and it
is far better even to learn from a book what you can in the
way of rules and exercises, than to go on singing by the
light of nature, or under a cheap and inefficient master, or
working at exercises too advanced for a beginner (which
is as bad as not working at any at all). I therefore give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
here a few simple but most important exercises, which you
may work at until you are able to place yourself under the
care of a good master. Bear in mind, first, all that has
already been said here about taking your breath, the position
of standing, the form of your mouth, and place of
throat, tongue, teeth, &amp;c., and study the following exercises
daily say to the extent of thirty minutes three times a day,
with full attention to all the above points:</p>

<div class="hide-link"><p class="center"><a href="music/practice.pdf">[Exercises in PDF]</a></p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">
<img src="images/063.png" width="591" height="100" alt="Exercise 1" title="Exercise 1" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/063.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>Sing this fully and firmly. It should be begun and
ended with the same quality and "thickness" of sound, as
suggested by the even line over each note. You should
be able to hold each note out in one breath for twenty
seconds without the slightest alteration being perceptible
in the tone, any more than there would be if it was a note
proceeding from an organ-pipe. Practise it on each of the
following sounds consecutively: "A" in "Bard," "A"
in "Fate," "E" in "Steel," "I" in "Life," "O" in
"Pole," "U" in "Rule," prefixing each sound by L, and
so singing Lah, Lay, Lee, Li, Lo, Loo. In singing this
first exercise, which for basses and barytones will be, of
course, an octave lower, be careful not to force the lower
notes, and do not seek to get a powerful tone thereupon.
The tone does not need to be full and heavy on these
notes, but rather should be a <span class="smcap">well-produced</span>, light, and
thin quality of note. The way to proceed is: (1) To inspire
the breath from the bottom of the lungs as it were&mdash;not
raising the shoulders. (2) Steady the breath for a second
or so in the chest while you THINK the note you are
about to sing, and while you prepare your throat and
mouth for singing by lowering the larynx and opening the
throat. (3) Then begin to sound the note&mdash;not from the
back of the mouth, but from the tip of the tongue and
the front teeth&mdash;thus taking the whole of the tone out of
the mouth, which is what is required to be done. Sustain
the note till you have only a little breath left&mdash;then finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
off in a clean manner, and allow the remaining breath to
leave the lungs and body in an orderly way.&mdash;Repeat the
same operation for <i>every</i> note, and if you desire to make
progress, give a minute's attention of this kind to every
single note.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 586px;">
<img src="images/064a.png" width="586" height="96" alt="Exercise 2" title="Exercise 2" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/064a.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>and so on, rising by semitones until you come to this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/064b.png" width="582" height="81" alt="Exercise 2, continued" title="Exercise 2, continued" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/064b.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>which is certainly the highest that you ought to attempt at
present.</p>

<p>Exercise No. 2 is a first step towards joining notes, and
is another difficulty in the matter of <i>production</i>. The
object to be aimed at is to sing the two notes which are
bound (or tied) together with the same breath, and the
same body and quality of tone. To step from C to E,
the first movement in the exercise is to raise the voice a
major third; but the student must pass from his mind
any notion of raising the throat in order to sound the
higher third. As the note E is higher than the C, the
tone of the former must be generated lower in the chest
than had been the case with the C. The higher the note
to be sung, the lower must be its generating-point in the
chest. This is the only way to <span class="smcap">open</span> the voice, and I need
scarcely say that it produces an entirely different tone and
method than are secured by the common habit of screwing
and tightening the throat, in proportion as the notes
ascend in pitch.</p>

<p>Another good exercise which may be combined with the
last-given is the following:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/064c.png" width="580" height="204" alt="Exercise 3" title="Exercise 3" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/064c.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>This exercise (3) must be sung in the same manner as
indicated with No. 2, care being taken as each note gets
higher to pass <i>under</i> the preceding note, and not as it
were to generate a high note over a lower one.</p>

<p>After which you may take this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/065a.png" width="592" height="100" alt="Exercise 4" title="Exercise 4" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/065a.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>but sing it very slowly and deliberately, bearing in mind
the production of the high notes.</p>

<p>As you begin to get all these notes firm and round, you
may take these same exercises in D, D<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, and E<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, but be
very careful not to force the upper notes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/065b.png" width="580" height="307" alt="Exercise 5" title="Exercise 5" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/065b.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>Exercise 5 is one where the question of the breath and
its proper management becomes of vital importance.
The reader will observe the notes are bound together, and
the student's attention should be turned towards passing
from one note to the other, without any appreciable difference
in the <i>quality</i>&mdash;I do not say pitch&mdash;of the tone.
Having inspired in the manner already explained, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
singer will sound the <i>Do</i> with a pure, sympathetic, not
harsh or forced sound; and by <i>pressing down</i> the breath,
will <i>lift</i> the voice on to the <i>Re</i>. When he has succeeded
with the step of a second, he can go on to the step of a
third, fourth, &amp;c. The care must be to utilize the breath,
always supporting the tone with the breath. If the sound
wavers, then there is something wrong with the breath.
You are either singing with too little, or are forcing the
breath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/066a.png" width="582" height="264" alt="Exercise 6" title="Exercise 6" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/066a.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>And so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/066b.png" width="582" height="182" alt="Exercise 7" title="Exercise 7" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/066b.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p>And so on, descending the scale by semitones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/066c.png" width="582" height="187" alt="Exercise 8" title="Exercise 8" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/066c.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Practise No. 8 slowly and steadily, with perfectly even
tone throughout, without any crescendo or diminuendo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let all the above exercises be taken successively, <i>forte</i>,
<i>a mezzo-voce</i>, and <i>piano</i>, preserving exactly the same amount
of tone throughout each passage, and holding the notes
with the same force with which you attack them steadily
to the end, not letting them die away. The trick of letting
notes die away is easily learnt afterwards, but at present
you have to master the far greater difficulty of holding
notes firmly with unvarying tone. Practise these exercises
on all the vowel-sounds already given. All such exercises
are of course only variations of the diatonic and chromatic
scales, so arranged as to prepare the voice for executing
those scales evenly and perfectly, with equality of tone on
every note; for till you can sing scales, you are not fit to
sing songs of any kind.</p>


<p><b>Duration of Practice.</b>&mdash;Always guard against over-straining
and over-working the voice. Do not sing or
practise for a longer time than half an hour without allowing
the voice rest for some time. If you have three hours
at your disposal daily to devote to singing, the most
economical use of the time is to divide it equally between
the morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>


<p><b>Singing in Tune</b>.&mdash;Correct intonation is of the
greatest possible importance in singing. Every singer
should pay especial attention to this point. The heavier
the voice, the more necessary becomes such attention,
and therefore contralti and basses are strongly advised to
lose no time in facing this (to them) considerable difficulty.
Deep basses, indeed, are rarely perfectly in tune for any
long time together, and some of the most famous bass
singers have left behind them recollections of this painful
defect. Therefore, whatever be your voice, do not take
for granted that even the possession of a good ear will
always ensure your singing in tune. Sometimes excellent
singers, and good musicians too, will sing out of tune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
perfectly aware that they are doing so, but, for a time,
unable to prevent it from physical causes&mdash;relaxation of
the throat, fatigue, indisposition, &amp;c., under which conditions
the muscles are unable to obey the will as usual.
Do not, then, make too light of this matter, because you
may think yourself quite incapable of singing out of tune;
it is at all events wiser to be on the safe side. Therefore,
never practise (nor sing, if you can help it) with a pianoforte
which is not well in tune and well "up to pitch."
And be very constant in practising intervals, such as major
and minor sixths and sevenths, so as to be able to strike
them as perfectly in tune and as unvarying in quality as
the notes of an organ diapason.</p>


<p><b>How to Begin.</b>&mdash;Many people never make a good
start when beginning to sing any piece. Now a very good
remedy for a part of this evil is not to prepare yourself
too soon. Use the bar immediately preceding that in
which your part commences to gather up your faculties,
and, to use a common phrase, "to pull yourself together;"
then let the muscles of the body gently settle down. The
ease and freedom acquired by this momentary call upon
the system is very remarkable; and for the singer especially
the hint cannot be too often acted upon.</p>


<p><b>Variety Indispensable.</b>&mdash;An unchanging volume of
sound is very soon wearying to the ear; and therefore a
singer who scarcely ever varies the pitch of his voice will
find that however loudly he may sing, his audience will
have a feeling of dissatisfaction, as though they could not
hear him distinctly&mdash;the fact being that their ears, being
fatigued with the uniformity of the noise, cannot do their
proper work, and the attention therefore flags. One great
secret of being agreeably heard by an audience is to vary
the body of tone (not the <i>quality</i> of it, observe). As a
rule singers are left tolerably free to do as they like in this
respect. Composers of songs rarely give them any help
in the matter. In fact, nowadays so many people compose
"vocal music" without knowing anything about the vocal
instrument for which they compose, that it is not wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that they ignore their power of helping the singer by
properly combining duly marked <i>forte</i>, <i>piano</i>, and <i>mezzo-voce</i>
passages, so as to ensure a variety of effect. Therefore,
in most modern music, a singer has to take his own
"reading" of a song, and to make it as effective as he
can by varying the power of his voice. It might even be
taken as a rule that every <i>forte</i> passage should be succeeded
by a soft one. The voice should rise and fall, and be
varied in its inflexions in that agreeable manner which is
so marked in good orators and dramatic elocutionists.</p>


<p><b>Chorus Singing.</b>&mdash;If you are studying seriously for
solo singing, you must discontinue all chorus singing,
especially during training. Singing in church choirs and
choral societies must be abandoned. And this not because
there is no good to be learned there, but because the little
good is by no means commensurate with the great amount
of harm which is acquired along with the good. To
enumerate here all the evil habits so easily learnt would
be impossible. Not the least of them, however, is the
tendency to shout louder than your neighbour, to use
yourself to the bad habits of those on each side of you;
to produce a bad tone; to "chop" the passages instead
of phrasing them; to attack notes carelessly; to sing
coarsely; to depend on others; to get into a machine-like
regularity of rendering the music. All these evil
habits are the result of chorus singing; and while many
of them are detrimental to the voice itself, it may be
safely said that any one of these habits is fatal to good
solo singing.</p>


<p><b>Humming.</b>&mdash;Some people have a wretched habit of
continually humming tunes. Pray do not get into this
habit of singing unconsciously&mdash;than which nothing is
more prejudicial to the voice. You should never sound a
note without being perfectly aware of what you are doing,
and that it is being done in the right manner. The faults
acquired by "humming over," as it is called, are of the
worst kind, and, moreover, they are far sooner acquired
than eradicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Studying Songs.</b>&mdash;Be careful, in studying a new song,
not to waste either time or strength by a trifling and superficial
treatment of it. "Whatever is worth doing at all,
is worth doing well." First of all, <i>sol-fa</i> the melody a
few times in a full <i>mezzo-voce</i>. Then study it with rather
stronger tone, paying attention to lights and shades, yet
at the same time being chiefly occupied with the melody
itself. Then make your breath-marks, and adhere to the
same unfailingly. Then sing the melody once throughout,
in order to find the weak places; having found which,
you need no more practise the whole of the melody, but
give all the attention to these latter phrases. Having
mastered these, the melody will be complete. It will then
be necessary to determine where the notes shall be made
to <i>bend</i> into each other, to add the <i>nuances</i>, a few graceful
figures and effects which belong alone to the true artist.</p>


<p><b>Imitation.</b>&mdash;By no means the worst lesson which you
can have will be gained by imitation of some acknowledged
first-rate singer, whose voice is of the same kind as your
own. Before going to a concert at which any such artist
is announced to sing, procure copies of his songs (if possible),
and make yourself acquainted with the compositions
first of all. Then go and hear how those works are rendered
by the singer who is to be your model; listen with
your copy in your hand; make notes of any points which
strike you, and while the impression made upon you is
still fresh, go home and imitate them as closely as you can.</p>


<p><b>General Musical Study.</b>&mdash;If you want to be a good
singing artist, many more things besides singing should be
studied. You should be sufficiently acquainted with the
pianoforte to play your own accompaniments, even of the
most difficult songs, well enough to get an idea of them.
Then a knowledge of harmony, counterpoint, and orchestration
is of the greatest value. The study of the best
scores, orchestral and vocal, should not be neglected, and
further, the student should make himself or herself otherwise
familiar with the rise and progress of the art, by
reading all the best books on the subject, whether historical,
critical, or biographical.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_STYLE" id="ON_STYLE">ON STYLE, EXPRESSION, &amp;c.</a></h2>


<p>The study of language, articulation, and deportment, the
gradual formation and building-up of the singing voice,
and the incessant practice of scales and exercises, are in
reality only the necessary preliminaries to singing itself.
Singing, or the proper use of the voice combined with the
due enunciation and expression of the words, is nothing
unless due attention be also paid to style, to the fit and
effective execution of the music selected, due regard being
paid both to taste and tradition.</p>


<p><b>Traditional Styles.</b>&mdash;Although the groundwork of
all good singing is the same, the music to be sung varies
greatly in style. There is church music, oratorio music,
and opera music, as well as ballad music; and a certain
nondescript&mdash;half recitative, half declamation&mdash;which is
of modern growth, gives pleasure to many people (both
performers and audience), and comprises the greater
number of modern German "songs."</p>


<p><b>Modern German Lieder.</b>&mdash;This latest development
of vocal performances, of which I desire to speak
with all due respect, has no traditions whatever, but it has
a style, decided, though (in my opinion) bad. It has,
however, one merit: it imperatively demands that the
singer should understand the meaning both of words and
music, for the whole thing depends on expression and
modulation. The composers of these works generally do
their part fully in the way of modulations and accompaniment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
but as they frequently forget to supply anything in
the shape of a melody, the singer must do his best to
touch or move his audience by his expressive delivery of
the words in the musical inflections which (with this class
of composers) occupy the place of a "tune." However,
if you admire this kind of music, and have been properly
taught to sing before you attempt to execute it, I have
not a word to say against it: so long as you use your voice
legitimately, this style of music can do you no harm, and
if you study dramatic expression and elocution properly,
you may doubtless produce an effect very pleasing to
others who admire it. But the danger of such music to
the untrained voice and untaught singer is very great
indeed; and I do not hesitate to say that the frequent
performance of it by such an one <i>must</i> result in the ruin
both of voice and style.</p>


<p><b>The Cathedral School.</b>&mdash;The one point in music
wherein England has just reason to boast of her past, is
the existence of a distinct class of music composed for
her church service, and that music of a high order of merit.
Distinctive in character, this church music&mdash;"services"
and "anthems"&mdash;has created for itself a distinct school
of singers, and, by tradition, demands a distinct style of
performance. I have elsewhere stated that the "Cathedral
School" of singing is "detestable for solo work," and
so it is for any solo work except cathedral solo work, where
the operatic or oratorio style of singing would seem to us,
who have always been familiar with the traditional and
one accepted style, out of place, and irreverently suggestive
of the concert-room. It is difficult to describe upon paper
the peculiarity of this style of singing, and it could only
be learnt by imitation in its own home, the cathedral. Its
chief characteristics are a sort of passionless "statuesqueness,"
a steadiness of tone akin to the notes of the organ,
which is its only fit accompaniment, an absence of all
attempt at personal display on the part of the singer. Its
faulty tendencies are towards deficiency of expression and
slowness of "attack;" these are apparent, generally, when
a "cathedral" singer appears in the concert-room; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in church, the pervadingly reverent character of the performance
takes off the impression of coldness and tameness
in the individual singer, while the ear, accustomed
to the slight difference in time with which the various
organ-stops "answer," does not notice in the singer that
want of "crispness" in the time which the accompaniment
of an orchestra reveals at once.</p>

<p>Unless you are really intending to sing professionally in
a church or cathedral choir, the study of this style will
not be of much use to you; you will find its good points
equally insisted on in the oratorio school of singing, while
its defects should be avoided in any. For <b>English part-singing</b>
there is, however, no training so good, its traditions
being exactly those of the finest old English secular part-music&mdash;the
madrigals of Wilbye, Weekes, and Purcell, &amp;c.</p>


<p><b>Oratorio.</b>&mdash;By oratorio singing&mdash;speaking of it as a
distinct style&mdash;I may say at once that I mean the school
of Handelian singing, of which the traditions are distinct,
and which has only been slightly modified to suit the more
modern oratorios of other composers. Of course, Mendelssohn
cannot be sung exactly like Handel or Bach, but
the general style of delivery should be the same, and till
you can sing Handel, you cannot hope to be able to sing
Mendelssohn. The ability to sing Handel, Bach, and
Glück, I believe to be the sole foundation for a pure style
of singing either in opera or ballad music: the music is
such that it cannot be trifled with&mdash;the difficulties cannot
be evaded, but must be mastered&mdash;while the exquisitely
smooth and vocal character of these great masters' music
trains the singer to an evenness and solidity of style which
is most valuable in any music that may be afterwards attempted.
Moreover, the songs of Handel form an admirable
school for the training of individual taste and judgment
in the introduction of ornaments, the variety of phrasing,
and other minute details of finish. Not that you may
exercise your individual taste in introducing ornaments
into Handel or Bach&mdash;far from it; but the songs are
written with the express intention that certain ornaments
should be introduced in particular places, and the style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
(and in many cases the notes) of these ornaments has
been accurately handed down to us; therefore, in learning
this traditional manner of singing such music, the student
is trained to a knowledge of the appropriate place for the
introduction of ornamentation and "grace"&mdash;the appropriate
character of such embellishments, and the appropriate
opportunities for introducing them. For instance,
most of Handel's songs commence with a movement which
is intended to be repeated at the close of the song, the
middle part being generally a movement in some relative
key, which is not repeated. The traditional style of giving
such songs is to reserve ornamentation for this repeated
first part, and thus to avoid the effect of sameness which
would result from adhering in the "repeat" to exactly the
same rendering of the music with which the singer gave it
at first. Such ornamentations were taken for granted by
the composer, and it was only because of a tasteless abuse
of this privilege of adornment on the part of foolish singers,
an abuse which became an unbearable nuisance, that in
after years Rossini adopted the plan of writing into his
music florid passages which should supply the singer with
ornaments which were good of their kind and which were
put in in appropriate places, rather then trust his airs to
the mercy of inartistic "decorators." Handel, and the
composers of earlier times than Rossini, omitted the ornamentation,
so as not to hamper the singer, for, as has been
well said by an old writer on the subject: "The same execution
that would from one singer afford pleasure, might
from another excite disgust: the compositions of old masters
have no written cadences to a repeated passage, for this
very reason, no doubt. But it is understood, and indeed
expected, that the singer of talent should display his own
taste by the introduction of such fanciful and graceful
ornaments as may be best calculated to exhibit his voice
to advantage, and thereby heighten, instead of lessen, the
effect of the composition."</p>

<p>The same writer, in explaining the reason for the introduction
of such ornaments and changes, goes on to remark:
"In conversation, though we frequently repeat words and
even sentences, in expressing any particular subject, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
we might as naturally expect to see a person laugh without
a smile, as give such repetitions without some variation in
voice and manner.</p>

<p>"The first part of an air is often written to be repeated.
In justice to the author, when that is the case, simplicity
of style should be inviolably preserved; but, on repeating
the strain, free scope may be given to the imagination,
taking it for granted that no person would be vain enough
to attempt the introduction of his own fanciful graces, unless
sufficiently master of the science to feel the propriety
of going so far and no farther."</p>

<p>Perhaps I may make the meaning of all this clearer by
giving a few specimens of these traditionally accepted
adornments in repeated passages.</p>

<p>And of course the list might be almost indefinitely prolonged.
Certain of these ornaments, once highly popular,
have wisely been allowed to drop, and that is why I lay
stress upon the importance of <i>accepted traditions</i>. You
may get hold of copies of many songs of this kind which
have the names of great singers attached to them, and yet
give variations of the text which have never been accepted
or generally approved. The great Braham himself was a
terrible offender sometimes in this respect. For instance,
in singing "<i>Comfort ye</i>," instead of the passage</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/078c.png" width="580" height="103" alt="Music" />

<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/078d.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>
<p class="lyrics">that her in - i - qui - ty is par - don - ed.</p>

<p>And I have seen an old copy of "<i>Holy, holy</i>," in which
the melody is so overlaid with little black notes, semi-quavers,
demi-semi-quavers, and semi-demi-semi-quavers,
that it is difficult to distinguish the notes of Handel's
music at all! The admissible changes are all very slight,
and any elaborate cadenza, or considerable addition, is
pretty sure to be wrong. Final high notes are a frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
snare to aspiring singers; the traditions of the old school
of oratorio singing are not in favour of them, and they
generally vulgarize a song if introduced where the composer
has not clearly opened a way for them. I have
heard a tenor singer conclude the famous "<i>Thou shalt
break them</i>," thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;">
<img src="images/079a.png" width="583" height="114" alt="Music" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/079a.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>
<p class="lyrics">pot - - - - - - - - - - - ter's ves - sel</p>

<p>and a soprano finish off "<i>He shall feed His flock</i>," thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;">
<img src="images/079b.png" width="583" height="119" alt="Music" />
<div class="hide-link"><a href="music/079b.mid">[Listen]</a></div>
</div>
<p class="lyrics">ye shall find rest ............... un - to your souls.</p>

<p>&mdash;both of them pieces of vulgar display, bringing the personality
of the singer before the audience instead of the
beauty of the music, the sense of the words, or the merit
of the composer. No such abominations are permissible
in good oratorio singing, the rule of which is utter submission
to the composer's intentions, and a conscientious
endeavour to interpret his mind clearly to the audience;
a pure and chaste delivery of words and music alike; a
sustained excellence throughout, avoiding an attempt to
astonish by bursts of power or brilliancy; and an entire
absence of all claptrap or vulgarities to please "the
gallery."</p>


<p><b>Opera.</b>&mdash;A great deal of what has been said about
oratorio singing applies also to operatic singing. But I
strongly advise you against attempting opera music until
you have studied the more severe and solid style of the
oratorio. The declamatory passages in opera are doubtless
more brilliantly impassioned, just as the florid airs are
more startlingly elaborate, than in oratorio, and the recitatives
less stately and sustained; but the style of good
opera singing is only to be founded upon good oratorio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
study (or its equivalent), inasmuch as it was out of the
oratorio that the opera grew. Operatic singing allows
more license to the singer than does oratorio; but the
singer should have been taught first by the severer style
not to misuse that license. At the same time when (as is
not infrequent in operas of a certain kind) the composer
has introduced airs for the express purpose of showing off
a singer's voice, a well-trained singer may be accepted as
interpreting the composer's intention rightly, when he or
she elaborates <i>fioriture</i> far beyond the limits of which any
hint appears in the score.</p>

<p>Even here, however, traditional usage must have its
weight: cadenzas must be strictly in character, and only
introduced in songs to which such passages are appropriate.
I once heard a florid cadenza interpolated at the close of
"<i>Spirto Gentil</i>," by an aspiring young tenor, too full of
conceit and "modern" ideas to take a hint from Mario's
marvellous rendering of that song.</p>

<p>And it must be borne in mind that it is only in operas
of the Bellini, Donizetti, and early Rossini and Verdi
school that such extreme license is granted. No such
tricks can be played with the operas of Mozart, Glück,
Weber, or Meyerbeer, or with the later works of Rossini
and Verdi, while the notion of altering a note, or omitting
even a demi-semi-quaver rest, in those of Wagner, would
be, to his admirers, flat heresy. In reality, the style of
singing opera music is easily acquired by any one who is
sufficiently advanced to be fit to attempt opera music at
all. There are certain niceties to be acquired, and endless
beauties of variety in the rendering of even small passages;
but these things cannot be taught on paper.</p>


<p><b>Ballads.</b>&mdash;There is no greater mistake than to suppose
that "any one can sing a simple ballad." Good ballad
singing is one of the rarest accomplishments, and demands
qualities in the singer which <i>may</i> be wanting even in a
person who can sing well both in opera and oratorio. To
suppose that an untaught singer can do justice to any
ballad that is worth the trouble of singing at all, is simply
a mark of ignorance on the whole subject of singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Ballads do not always require power or compass of voice,
it is true, nor do they tax the singer on the score of flexibility
or physical strength; but they are the severest test
of enunciation, <i>mezzo-voce</i> singing, neatness and readiness
in producing tones of any gradation, and perfect control
over the voice.</p>

<p>To sing a ballad well demands a really cultivated taste,
a certain dramatic power, suppressed it is true, but influencing
the whole delivery; a sympathetic voice, and a
manner which will enlist the interest and sympathy of the
audience. Ballad singing is neither declamation nor recitative:
there is no chance of surprising or astonishing your
audience; but you <i>must</i> contrive to please them, you must
<i>touch</i> them somehow; and, for an ordinary person in the
costume of the nineteenth century, to "touch" others of
the same species is not easy. Sometimes, no doubt, the
words of a good song are in themselves so touching and
charming that, so long as the music be not positively hideous
or destructive of the sense of the words, the singer has
only to let them be clearly heard, and the battle is won;
but more frequently he has to trick his audience into
interest in a song where the words in themselves are either
hopelessly silly, or too obscure in sense for their full meaning
to appear at a first hearing or reading. All that he can
then do is to deliver it in such a way that they shall feel
that there <i>is</i> a meaning to it all, though they have not fully
caught it yet, and so they may wish to hear it again. I do
not, of course, mean any allusion to the ridiculous fashion
of <i>encores</i>, but simply that the feeling at the end of such a
song should be one of liking it sufficiently to wish to understand
it entirely.</p>

<p>Many songs would tell their own tale and produce their
own effect well enough, if the singer would let them, and
therefore the ballad singer must only be sufficiently self-conscious
to keep himself out of the way. However good
his singing, however original his reading of the song, <i>while
he is singing</i> it should all go to the credit of the song, and
the hearers be charmed into forgetting <i>him</i> till he is silent.</p>


<p><b>Recitative.</b>&mdash;Good recitative singing is of great importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and requires careful attention and study. Recitative
is midway between speaking and singing; it is a
sort of modulated intoning, that is, that in delivering it
the note and the word that belongs to it should be given
with equal intention, and appear to belong to each other
so completely that the musical sound should seem to be
the natural intonation which the reciter would give to the
word. Recitative is (<i>or was</i>) practically an attempt to express,
in musical notation, the inflexions of the human
voice in speaking; and how accurately, in some cases,
musical notation can do this, will be seen at a glance by
the following illustration:</p>

<p class="lyrics">Who are you?</p>

<p>&mdash;where the question is asked in the same words, but the
musical notes express clearly three different sentiments, or
degrees of sentiment. This should be taken into consideration
by the student; and he should strive to give
his recitative with as natural a delivery as he can, placing
himself mentally in the position of a dramatic reciter.</p>

<p>Steadiness of tone, clearness of enunciating consonants,
and full round delivery of vowel-sounds are indispensable
to good recitative singing. Every note must be distinct,
and not the faintest suspicion of a "slur" or <i>portamento</i>
can be allowed.</p>

<p>Recitative singing is not a thing which a student should
try to teach himself, as he may not only waste his time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
but gain notions which are erroneous and difficult to cure.
For instance, take the recitatives in "<i>The Messiah</i>," as
these are printed for the British public. Nothing could
be more ludicrous than for a singer to appear in public
and sing the recitatives faithfully as printed in the editions
of this oratorio which are continually being disseminated
throughout the land. Handel, let it be borne in mind,
was <i>not</i> well acquainted with the English language; and
though he may have written good music, he was often
very far from reaching good literary sense. Thus, as regards
this latter, this specimen passage occurs in Handel's
"<i>Acis and Galatea</i>,"</p>

<p class="lyrics">Where shall I seek the charm-ing fair?</p>

<p>inasmuch as there is some doubt of the chord 6/4 which
forms the grace note being Handel's music, and because
the sense of the words demands that no break shall be
made between the words <i>seek</i> and <i>the</i>. As Handel failed
in his English, it is surely allowable to make good his
deficiencies in this respect.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs relate to certain minor details
of style in singing, and apply to singing of every kind.
They must be taken in conjunction with much that has
already been said under the head of "Practice."</p>


<p><b>Slurring.</b>&mdash;Slurring up to a note is a very disagreeable
and common evil to be guarded against. It matters not
how far distant the note to be sung may be from the preceding
tone; it should be attacked fearlessly and cheerfully,
but <i>with an open throat</i>. The note to be attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
must not be prepared in the throat. The course should
be this. The tone of the preceding note must not be
moved, but the one required&mdash;say a very high one&mdash;must
be obtained by the joint process of lowering the larynx,
of sounding the note from exactly the same spot as the
lower note, in a soft but fine tone, and thirdly, by getting
such a ring in the note as it can only have in conjunction
with the feeling that while the root or foundation of the
note is in the chest, yet it owes much of its penetrating
character and power to a sort of reflecting power which is
given it from the extreme end of the spine bone, where
it joins the head. Certainly no high note is properly
<i>produced</i>, nor to be relied upon for a <i>crescendo</i>, unless the
student has this feeling that it springs from the back of
the neck; and, in rising to an upper note, the aim should
be not at length to approach the upper note from beneath,
as it were, but to "come down" upon it&mdash;to strike it from
<i>above</i> instead of from below.</p>


<p><b>Sentiment.</b>&mdash;Always try to convey the sentiment of
what you may be singing through the tone of the voice.
Love and anger cannot both be expressed with the same
quality of voice. For the former, a delicate light tone
well on the lips is desirable, while for the latter the voice
should be produced lower in the stomach; yet the tone
should still be kept on the lips; its character should be
"darker," more round, and sonorous. "'<i>Tis this that
racks my brain</i>"" such words as these should never be
sung in the same character of voice as "<i>Waft her, angels,
to the skies</i>." It is good practice to take any piece and
sing the melody on an open vowel throughout, with the
object of showing the meaning of the song without the
aid of words. Then, when this can be done, the words
may be employed, and the result will be doubly happy.</p>


<p><b>Decision.</b>&mdash;Indecision is a very serious fault in singing.
Do well and thoroughly whatever you decide upon
attempting. If you have a <i>staccato</i> passage to sing, render
it firmly in that style; if you have one that is <i>legato</i>, take
care that this character is <i>strongly</i> seen from your rendering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
When you "slur," make it strong enough to be felt.
If you bend as it were from one note to another, let your
intention to do so be clearly apparent. Let a <i>forte</i> passage
be loud, and let a <i>piano</i> one be really soft. Any half
measures in singing are fatal. Precision and certainty are
qualities which the student must always aim at attaining.
Without them, singing becomes tame and unattractive,
not to say tiresome.</p>


<p><b>Imitation.</b>&mdash;Imitation, which in many other arts becomes
plagiary, in singing is most desirable; for singing,
more than any other art, rests on tradition; there is even
very little doubt that the peculiar charm and quality of a
true tenor voice (for instance) is more due to imitation in
a singer than to nature; that is to say, that it is the result
of a transmitted culture&mdash;such imitation being the only
means in which singers can reap the harvest of the experience
of the great singers now to be heard no more, who
have left their imitators to pass on to others what they
themselves obtained by imitating and improving on <i>their</i>
predecessors. Therefore do not be afraid of being set
down as a mere copyist, if you study and attempt to imitate
the style of the best living singers. You will always
have enough of your own merit or defect to distinguish
your performance, if you are really a conscientious student,
and you may learn a great deal by listening to the best
public singers which can be taught you in no other way.
Watch their stage deportment; their treatment of the
weaker parts of their voices; their method of breathing;
their manner towards the public;&mdash;in fact, every point
which occurs to you,&mdash;and make some use of what you
see and hear in your own studies.</p>


<p><b>Public Singing.</b>&mdash;If you have to sing in public, remember
always to take a rapid but searching glance round
your stage. This is a great point gained. As you step
on to "the boards," notice (unobserved) the dimensions
of the stage (if it happens to be new to you). Note the
height of its ceiling, its surroundings, its draperies, its distance
from your farthest auditor; then take up your position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
accordingly&mdash;bearing in mind that all your tone is
wanted by your listeners, which requirement can never be
met unless you yourself take the precaution to prevent
the sound being held or carried back by the stage decorations.
In a concert <i>salon</i> or theatre, then, do not forget
to get well to the front of the platform. At the same time
you must not be <i>too</i> close upon your stall occupants, or
you may give them the very undesirable impression that at
any moment you may fall over.</p>


<p><b>"Holding" an Audience.</b>&mdash;The singer should carefully
watch an audience so as to gauge its attention and
sympathies. If it seems impatient, restless, and indifferent,
the singer may be quite sure that he or she is exciting no
interest. The best course then for one to do is to immediately
change the style, alter the tone, give forth his or her
best energies, and use every effort to become ingratiated
into the good favour of the listeners. If such effects as these
fail constantly in their turn, then the aspirant for vocal fame
should give up, and devote both time and attention to further
study, or to some other means of a livelihood; for a
future great singer will not be failing constantly, and to be
only a second-rate singer while there are so many is a thing
<i>not</i> to be devoutly desired.</p>


<p><b>Mistakes in Public.</b>&mdash;If you make a mistake in singing,
do not add to the mischief by allowing it to alarm or
disconcert you. Proceed onward as if nothing had happened.
You may be quite sure that each one of your
audience will not have detected the slip, for they cannot
<i>all</i> be critics. But bear in mind that such confidence as
your adviser here suggests is not to be too often called
into requisition. No great artist will ever make a serious
mistake in public. How much more careful then should
the young student be!</p>

<h2><a name="ON_TIME_IN_SINGING" id="ON_TIME_IN_SINGING">ON TIME IN SINGING.</a></h2>


<p>I need perhaps scarcely remind my readers who are or
who wish to be singers that <i>time</i> concerns them quite as
much as the conductor, the pianist, the violinist&mdash;in short,
the whole orchestra. It behoves the student in singing
to give early and careful attention to this important feature
in his artistic training. You may have the voice of a
Rubini, you may be a second Tamburini in quality and
extent of voice, but unless you can sing in time yourself,
and are able to do so with others, and with the counter-acting
influences of an orchestra, you can never hope to
rise in your profession. It may be argued that you have
no desire to lay yourself out for a career on the lyric stage.
Then, however, you shut yourself out from some of the
largest prizes in the profession; beyond which there comes
the question of oratorio business, and the growing taste
for band accompaniments to songs. And if you restrict
your ambition to a pianoforte accompaniment, time is
needed even with that in order to produce anything like a
satisfactory rendering of the piece you may be singing. The
accompanyist may be a Sir Julius Benedict, or a Signor
Randegger (than whom there is no better in this country,
so neglected has this species of musical art-work become);
but a perfect rendering depends not so much upon the
pianist as the vocalist. If the singer flounders about with
neither "rhyme nor reason," it is scarcely reasonable to
expect the accompanyist, clever as he may be, to be always
at his heels, like a cat after a mouse. I would therefore
advise the student to invest his money in a Metronome&mdash;the
most useful thing with which he could provide himself.
They are not dear, bearing in mind their utility,
and one will, I am sure, save the student much time and
many a <i>fiasco</i>. Learn the working of this useful machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and practise all your exercises with it. If you go to a
good singing master, you should ask him to time your
exercises to the pace at which you should sing them, and
in this way you will not only be growing in a good habit,
but your singing will be characterized by a crispness and
a certainty of attack, which will be apparent to all musicians
and amateurs with good taste. Your singing
master will, no doubt, impress upon you the necessity of
singing your songs in time, and especially of slightly accenting
the first and third beats in the bar if it is common
time, the first and fourth beats when it is compound common
or 6/8 time, and the first beat when it is triple or 3/4 time.
In this way there will be meaning given to your singing,
and those who may be accompanying you will be able to
feel where you are, and to keep time with you. In singing
a passage like this from Cowen's charming song "Aubade,"&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>master, if he knew his business, would instruct his
pupil to slightly accent the words as I have indicated with
the mark <img src="images/088-v.png" width="12" height="13" title="V for accented words" alt="V" />, and to preserve <i>strict</i> time throughout the passage,
and especially in the taking up of the words after the
long note on the word <i>sleep</i>. The accompanyist would, we
may assume, do likewise with his pianoforte part, and in
this way a perfect <i>ensemble</i> would be secured.</p>

<p>With this brief introduction to the subject, I will proceed
to give the student a few exercises in keeping and beating
time, the assiduous practice of which will, I hope, soon
place him in the desirable position of being able to sing
in time.</p>

<p>These exercises may be timed as slow as you like on
your metronome&mdash;the slower the better&mdash;but 76 is a good
pace to begin with; when you have thoroughly mastered
them at 76, take them a little quicker until you can sing
them accurately up to a good brisk time.</p>

<p>No 1 has but one note in the bar, and this must be held
on steadily for four beats of the metronome&mdash;care being
taken to leave each note in sufficient time to take a fresh
breath, and attack the second note and syllable in precise
time with the metronome beat. I need, perhaps, scarcely
point out that much good will be obtained if the student
can accustom himself to <i>feeling</i> in his mind the rhythm and
beating, so as not to acquire the habit of trusting to mechanical
appliances, which are dispensed with at public
performances. The sol-fa-ing must be strictly adhered to,
and in Exercises 2, 3, etc., it will be seen that the syllable
must be sounded twice and four times respectively. With
Exercise 5 the dotted note comes in; but I will not stay
to explain that, as I assume that my readers will have acquainted
themselves with the elements of musical theory
before taking up singing. Especial care should be given
to Exercise 7, as that is the first step in the difficult matter
of syncopation, carried out elaborately in Exercises 8 and
9. With Exercise 11 the question of Rests comes in, but
the same remark that I made as to the dotted notes applies
here. Everything that it is necessary to know about them
should be found in any elementary musical grammar.</p>

<p>Having mastered the above exercises, the reader may
take the following with two beats in the bar&mdash;taking the
precaution to set them at a slow time on the metronome,
say 76, not singing them quickly until he is thoroughly
acquainted with them.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_CHOICE_OF_MUSIC" id="ON_THE_CHOICE_OF_MUSIC">ON THE CHOICE OF MUSIC.</a></h2>

<p class="blockquot">There are, of course, no <i>rules</i> to be given to guide the
student in the choice of music, except the general ones, to
choose good music, pleasing music, and music suited to
his voice and powers. But those general rules touch incidentally
on a few points on which it may be well to offer
a few remarks.</p>


<p><b>Music must suit the Voice.</b>&mdash;Your music must
not only be appropriate for your voice in compass, but it
must be such as has been written for a voice of your kind.
This is a most important thing to remember. Nothing is
more provoking to a person of good taste and musical
knowledge than to hear songs composed for a voice of one
class sung by a voice of a totally different character; and
yet this is a vice which even good artists will sometimes
weakly succumb to. The popular song of Gounod's,
"<i>Quand tu chantes berçée</i>," for instance, has been sung to
death by many soprani and contralti, in various keys. One
would have thought that the words alone would have shown
them the utter absurdity of what they were doing; but no,
for the sake of producing an effect (upon an audience who
naturally supposed that public singers of high standing
knew what they were doing, and why they did it), these
good ladies committed what I do not scruple to call a
vulgar and inartistic blunder. The song is a man's song,
and no woman should attempt it.</p>

<p>This fault is one which amateurs are very apt to fall into,
and a long list might be made of songs which have suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
this unfair treatment. Soprani sing tenor songs&mdash;(I have
often, in the early days of the popularity of "<i>Il Trovatore</i>,"
heard a soprano sing "<i>Ah, che la Morte!</i>"&mdash;tenors, those
written for soprano&mdash;(<i>e.g.</i>, I know an amateur tenor whose
"crack" song is Iphis' "Farewell" in "<i>Jephtha</i>"). Contralti
and mezzo-soprani steal bass and barytone songs, as "But
who may abide," from the "<i>Messiah</i>," and basses and
barytones return the compliment by appropriating "What
tho' I trace," or "O rest in the Lord.")</p>

<p>There is a reason, quite apart from the question of taste,
which renders this practice objectionable. A composer of
any skill writes his accompaniment as well as his melody
with reference to the voice which he wishes to sing it.
Now, if that voice be&mdash;we will say&mdash;a soprano, the accompaniment
will be written for a voice of that <i>pitch</i>, as
well as of that character and compass; the progressions
of harmony will be written with due regard to the actual
place of the vocal notes in the scale. But directly the
song is sung by a tenor&mdash;a voice which pitches every note
an octave lower than the soprano&mdash;the relation of the
vocal notes to the accompaniment is changed; notes that
were intended to be fourths above the accompaniment
will become fifths below, and progressions which were
correct in the composer's intention become wrong in the
effect produced by the singer. That is an extreme case, I
grant, but it is only a fair instance of the sort of result
which follows on such changes, and it is sufficient to show
that the rule rests on reason and not caprice.</p>


<p>"<b>Original Keys.</b>"&mdash;Do not bind yourself, as some
think it necessary to do, always to sing your songs in the
original keys. Remember that opera and oratorio music,
and a large number of modern "ballads," were composed
for performance in large buildings, theatres, and concert-rooms.
The keys, therefore, were chosen with due reference
to that fact, and to the (in many cases) exceptional
voices of the singers. The raising of the pitch in later
years also affects the question.</p>

<p>Now, if you have to sing in a drawing-room, the pitch,
volume of tone, and style of delivery must be appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to chamber music, and not to the stage of Covent Garden,
and the keys which are necessary for due brilliancy and
effect in a concert-room are frequently unsuited to a drawing-room,
giving an appearance of strain and noisiness to
the singing. A good deal of opera music is as unfit for
singing in a drawing-room as would be a grand symphony
for performance there; and an artistic singer should bear
in mind this principle of fitness in his selection.</p>

<p>At the same time, if it is considered desirable to transpose
a song, let it be only for that reason, and let the aim
be to produce the same effect, <i>relatively</i>, in the drawing-room,
as the song in its original key is intended to produce
in the concert-room. Do not transpose recklessly, merely
to "suit your voice:" if you are a barytone, for instance,
do not sing tenor songs a few notes lower; or, if you are
a soprano, do not transpose contralto songs to suit your
register. For the <i>character</i> of the music (if the music is
good) suits the voice for which it was intended, and there
is a risk of destroying that character by giving it to a voice
of another kind. This has been proved over and over again
on the stage in several notable instances.</p>


<p><b>Execution.</b>&mdash;Do not be too ambitious in selecting
florid songs for performance either in public or private.
"Fireworks" in a drawing-room rarely please, while in a
concert-room they must be very perfect and first-rate in
execution to do so. Of course, if you are a professional
artist you must include such work in your studies, and even
for the amateur the practice of florid music, under a master,
is most desirable as an exercise. But where the choice of
a song for a concert rests with yourself, sacrifice ambition
to prudence, unless your voice is naturally a very flexible
one, and your training in that style of music very complete.
I give, on this subject, a quotation from an old and experienced
writer on music and singing:</p>

<p>"Execution is certainly one of the most difficult parts
of musical science. Young singers are desirous of attaining
it without reflecting whether, from the formation of
the throat and various physical causes, they may ever be
able to accomplish their wishes. Few, indeed, possess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
power of execution in a pre-eminent degree. It is in part
a gift of nature: those who have ever delighted as well as
astonished us by their rapid manner of running through
divisions must have been naturally endowed with flexible
organs.</p>

<p>"... Some voices may be compared to gems
which in their original state are dull, and, to those unacquainted
with their worth, of no value.... It
frequently happens that singers, from timidity or want of
proper knowledge in exercising their voices, remain ignorant
of their own qualifications. The hinges of a door
which have continued for years undisturbed, will, when
the door is re-opened, grate harshly on the ear; but every
effort renders the harshness more tolerable, until, from
frequent use, they move easily. Thus it is with the voice:
on the flexibility of the <i>uvula</i> and the muscles connected
with it depend both the perfectibility of the shake and
execution. But still it must be acknowledged that acquired
execution should never be exercised by the side of nature
otherwise than sparingly, even where necessity requires it,
for the latter possesses an easy velocity which can playfully
sport with its subject at will; but, however gratifying the
power of execution may be considered by those who possess
it, I recommend them not to be indiscriminately lavish,
lest they cloy by too great a profusion, and, as Voltaire
remarks, 'shine in trills and divisions, at the expense of
poetry and good sense.'"</p>


<p><b>Fashion.</b>&mdash;The songs which are "the rage" at any
time are always great snares for amateurs. Aspiring
young singers hear a ballad charmingly rendered by some
great singer, and straightway go home, send for it, and
on the first available opportunity treat their friends to
their version of it. This is really unfair to themselves,
as it throws them into unwise contrast with the public
singer who has made the song popular, and whose well-known
rendering of it forbids ordinary hearers to judge
the rendering of an amateur on its own merits, or by any
rule but that of comparison. Moreover, "popular" songs&mdash;I
mean songs whose popularity is largely due to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
having been sung by favourite public singers&mdash;are by no
means always good in themselves; or, if fairly good, by
no means easy; or if good and not difficult, by no means
always sufficiently so to make it worth while for an amateur
to spend time and study on them. In very many cases
the public singer has to sing these songs because he is
paid for doing so, and gets a "royalty" on every copy
sold; it is simply one development of the hydra-headed
art of advertising, and such productions are known by the
vulgar name of "pot-boilers," <i>i.e.</i>, compositions hastily
thrown off to bring in a little money "<i>to keep the pot
boiling</i>." If composers who are capable of better things
are reduced to making money in this way, we may be
sincerely sorry for them; but speaking from an artistic
point of view, the practice is reprehensible, and "pot-boilers"
are not the kind of music which a young singer,
anxious to improve, should waste time or money upon.
I am far from saying that there are no good songs to be
found among new music, but I think they seldom lie on
the top of the pile.</p>


<p><b>Forming a Repertoire.</b>&mdash;In gradually forming your
<i>repertoire</i>, or collection of properly studied songs for drawing-room
or concert singing, do not be in haste to make
it a large one. It is better to know only a few songs and
do them really well, than to sing a large number indifferently.
If you are studying for the profession, there is a
considerable number of songs which you will be expected
to know as a matter of course, but over and above such,
every singer should have a special repertoire of his or her
own, and it is of this that I now speak. Your selection
of songs, like your singing, should have the stamp of your
own individuality upon it. You should have a little stock
of songs, with which your singing is in a way identified, and
which you must be able to sing in a manner that at once
stamps those songs as your property, so that another person
might say, "I could not sing that song before you, it
is one of your own."</p>

<p>To form such a repertoire, you may have to go a little
out of the beaten track of what is best known at the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
If opera music suits you best, look at the operas, never
performed now, of Glück, or the less known of Mozart's,
or earlier works of Rossini, Auber, &amp;c.; or else try and
get hold of works not yet known in England, such as
Macfarren's, Wallace's, Purcell's, and a few other such
native dramatic composers. In a word, do not limit
your notions of operatic music to what you hear year
after year at Covent Garden or Her Majesty's.</p>

<p>So, too, in oratorio: search in the less familiar oratorios
of Handel, and such of his operas as you can get access
to, and carry the same idea out in examining the works
of other composers, ancient and modern. Good work
has been done of late years by various publishers in publishing
many works of this class, and there are plenty of
these which are still unfamiliar and unhackneyed.</p>

<p>The same with your songs and ballads: before you rush
into the modern fashionable ballad, see if you cannot find
a few that you can appropriate among the stores of old
English music, or the detached songs of old Italian masters
(many of which are magnificent as songs, and utterly unknown
at present, except to the few).</p>

<h2><a name="PHYSIOLOGICAL_SURROUNDINGS" id="PHYSIOLOGICAL_SURROUNDINGS">PHYSIOLOGICAL SURROUNDINGS.</a></h2>


<p>It is highly expedient that singers themselves, and intending
students of the art, should make some acquaintance
with the physiological surroundings which are
brought into play in the process of voice production. A
knowledge of the technical terms for the various organs
directly involved is very essential, and the intelligent
student will see the necessity not only for distinguishing
such names as "larynx" and "diaphragm," but also of
possessing some idea of their whereabouts in the human
frame. No better course could be adopted for the acquirement
of such a knowledge than attendance at the
classes and lectures at the musical colleges and other institutions,
which, from time to time, secure the assistance
of qualified specialists to speak upon this very important
branch of the singing art. No other mode of teaching is
so well calculated to enlighten the uninitiated in the wondrous
mechanism of the human voice, and to inspire him
or her with an adequate sense of the watchful care and
delicate treatment which a voice worthy of systematic
training demands, as well as deserves, at the hands of
students of both sexes. As a preliminary to a fuller inquiry
into the subject, the following few notes may be
fixed upon the mind:&mdash;</p>


<p><b>The Larynx</b> (<span lang="el" title="larynx">&lambda;&#8049;&rho;&upsilon;&gamma;&xi;</span>) constitutes the upper part of the
wind-pipe. It is the seat of the voice, and essential parts
of it are the "vocal cords" (<i>chordæ vocales</i>), two membranes
in a horizontal position across the larynx. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
popularly called "Adam's apple" (<i>pomum Adami</i>), the
protuberance so often recognizable in the throats of bass
singers, but a more correct use of "<i>pomum Adami</i>" is when
it is applied to a projection in the thyroid cartilage&mdash;a
part of the laryngeal structure.</p>

<p><b>The Thyroid</b> (from <span lang="el" title="Thyreos">&Theta;&upsilon;&rho;&epsilon;ό&sigmaf;</span>) is a shield-shaped cartilage,
and that part of the larynx which, in the case of
both sexes, develops suddenly at the period when they
pass from youth to mature age. Other important cartilages
are the cricoid (from <span lang="el" title="krikos">&kappa;&rho;ί&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>), a ring-shaped membrane;
the arytenoids (from <span lang="el" title="harytaina">&#7937;&rho;&#8059;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&alpha;</span> a pitcher); the epiglottis
(<span lang="el" title="epi-glôtta">&#7952;&pi;ί-&gamma;&lambda;&omega;&tau;&tau;&alpha;</span>), situated at the back of the mouth; and
the cartilages of Santorini, or <i>cornicula laryngis</i>.</p>

<p>The trachea, or wind-pipe, is capable of rising or falling,
and thus is produced the perceptible movement of the
larynx in the throat when speaking or singing. It is by
lowering the larynx, and so commanding an expansion of
the throat that the best tone is possible in the voice, and
it is this open throat production which some teachers are
aiming at when they charge their pupils to "sing from the
chest." A more sensible request would be to "lower
the larynx," since such a lowering of this organ places the
throat in the most favourable position for emitting sound;
as well as for enabling the lungs, or wind-chests, to act
most advantageously upon the true vocal cords. Moreover,
this lowered larynx production leads to the best
results from the vocal cords themselves. The natural
tendency is to sing as we talk, a process which involves a
demand upon the upper fringes of the vocal ligaments
only, but no long-sustained singing could be maintained
by this means, nor does it requisition any art-knowledge
or principle. Directly, however, we begin to utilize the
lower edge of the vocal cords, we are verging upon the
art of <i>producing</i> the voice; <i>i.e.</i>, creating a something which
will not manifest itself without the first application of
some art principles. Here lies the whole secret of
singing, <i>viz.</i>, the utilization of the lower portions of the
membranous folds popularly called the "vocal cords,"
instead of working merely their topmost fringes, as do the
innumerable tenors who sing "throaty," and as we all do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
up to a certain point, in the ordinary process of speaking.
The singing voice and the speaking voice are two totally
different productions, the former never to be acquired
except at the hands of a capable master, who, himself,
has been properly taught the principles of voice production.</p>

<p>The lungs, or bellows, or air-chambers lie, as is well
known, on each side of the chest, resting upon the diaphragm,
and performing a very important function in
singing. They supply the air which acts upon the vocal
cords, and in true singing are the first organs for consideration
by a vocalist, since so much depends upon the
way the wind, or breath, is brought to bear upon the
vocal cords. For this reason the abdominal method of
breathing&mdash;the filling of the lungs from their bases&mdash;becomes
the best method for inspiring the breath in
singing. Doubtless, in breathing, the lungs are replenished
from above downwards, but it requires something
of the sensation of these air-supplying substances
being filled from their bases in order to requisition the
full help of the diaphragm, a great muscle which separates
the lungs from the abdomen, and which may be called
the fundamental basis on which all voice production
rests.</p>

<p>The Pharynx (<span lang="el" title="pharynx">&phi;&#8049;&rho;&upsilon;&gamma;&xi;</span>) is situated behind the mouth,
between the tongue and the arch forming the circumference
of the palate. Its province is to reflect the voice
on its issue from the glottis. It is an elastic aperture,
and may be well styled the reflecting organ of singing.
It can take various forms, and bears a great part in giving
character to the sounds originated in the larynx.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Voice&mdash;a Wind, Reed, or String Instrument?</i> Much
discussion has spent itself in settling the question of
"family" to which the vocal instrument properly belongs.
The vocal chords are known to be composed of a yellow
elastic fibrous tissue in their anterior parts, the posterior
portions consisting of a tougher muscle or cartilage.
Many maintain them to belong to the "string" family,
since the sounds generated are produced as on a violin&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
higher notes by increased tension, the lower tones by
a reduction of the strain. In this process, the muscle,
popularly known as the epiglottis-cushion&mdash;a fat mucous
membrane&mdash;presses on to the vocal cords, modifying
their vibrating length. Thus, in an extreme high note,
the cushion presses intensely upon the cords, considerably
shortening their one inch length. In reverting to a low
note, this tension becomes withdrawn, and the whole length
of cord is at play to produce its lowest tones. An unfortunate
objection to this theory&mdash;that the vocal cords can
be styled a stringed instrument, is the fact that no string of
the small extent of the vocal cords could be capable of
sounding either so many, or such low notes; moreover,
the mathematical treatment of their vibrations, as
governed by the tension, is not correct, as they are in the
case of a violin. It is a useful theory, and method of
reasoning, however, for those teachers of singing who
maintain that to get high notes, a light and thin style
of singing, and the use of the upper fringe of the vocal
cords (the production point), is preferable, in contradistinction
to those who declare that no really good chest
note with any telling power worth considering is possible,
unless the vocalist sings deep in his chest and gains the
idea, as he goes for his note, of requisitioning with all effort
the lowest depth in the cord. Surely this point presents
the greatest difficulty for singers with whom compass,
especially at the top of the voice, is an imperative necessity,
albeit that people go on talking to the contrary; and it is
a matter which needs settling among voice specialists and
singing masters. We are told, and it is generally known,
that the tension of the epiglottis-cushion produces a
higher note just as the shifting of the finger on the violin
string affects its tone&mdash;a process which may produce
falsetto sounds, but which surely is not the basis upon
which great Italian singers of the Mongini and Tamberlik
type secured the great chest Cs, which, with their
resonance and brilliancy, were wont to make our opera
houses ring again. Is it not a fact that in voices of
this calibre, as well as in those trained on what is known
as the broad lines of the true Italian production, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
whole surfaces of the vocal cords become more or less requisitioned,
and that they vibrate the whole of their
length and breadth, not merely the sides, rather than that
any upper portion is mainly utilized while the lower parts
are resting? The answer to this question would seem
to indicate that the human voice is of the nature of a reed
instrument. These membraneous organs, which we term
vocal cords, are such that their whole surfaces must vibrate
when brought into contact with a current of air from the
lungs. The voice reed, in fact, vibrates freely backwards
and forwards, and so corresponds with what are known
as "free," not "beating" reeds&mdash;such as are found in
concertinas, and the like.</p>

<p>That the voice is something of an organ pipe (a flue
pipe) is an illusion only indulged in by writers and teachers
prone to descriptive language, which they do not stay to
inquire into, either for their own edification or for the
enlightenment of other people. There is absolutely nothing
to maintain such an idea.</p>

<p>It is important that the nature of the <i>matériel</i> of the
vocal cords should become widely known, since such a
knowledge, elementary as it might be, would, at the outset,
enable students to get at once upon the right road to
singing. To grasp the idea that the initial sound-producing
means are these bits of semi-lunar membranes, acted
upon by the breath from the lungs, and that they vibrate
violently or orderly in proportion to the care with which
the breath is brought to bear upon them, is to master
the first great difficulty in singing. This once grasped,
it is not hard to realize that the sound emitted is moulded
and shaped, modified and beautified by other organs of
the laryngeal machine and its surroundings, as well as by
such variable conditions as the state of the human frame
generally, and the particular condition of those organs of
the body most directly concerned in supporting the work
of the larynx may happen to be in. It will save the student
much time if, before he (or she) begins to study singing,
some first acquaintance be formed with the physiological
surroundings of the human voice, and it is worse than
useless to go to a master who teaches singing in blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ignorance of, and doubtless contempt for, these physiological
principles. The student who has familiarized
himself with the structure of the vocal organs will have
made a much more intelligent progress in his art than
the one who has not, and will be competent none the
less readily to understand the instruction of a qualified
master than to detect the shameful pretence and humbug
of the quack.</p>


<p><b>Board Teachers' Laryngitis&mdash;Clergyman's
Sore Throat&mdash;Throat Exhaustion, etc.</b>&mdash;Among
the greatest evils of this competitive teaching age is the
mischief arising from the constant and at the same
time injurious use of the voice. All who use the voice
constantly must learn how to breathe, and <i>produce</i> the
voice. Failing that, serious mischief, which even the
specialist of throat hospitals cannot cope with, must
inevitably follow. The only advice that can be given
here is, immediately that voice exhaustion sets in, to
consult not <i>a doctor</i>, but a throat or voice specialist.
The best institution in the world for throat troubles is
the Throat Hospital, Golden Square, London, W.</p>

<h2><a name="EXERCISES" id="EXERCISES">EXERCISES.</a></h2>


<p>This first exercise is a most useful one in the uniting
of notes and in gaining facility. The student should at
first practise it very slowly, mastering four bars at a time.
Although I have divided it into fifteen examples, it is really
but one exercise, with a minim rest between each phrase
of four bars; and it is in this example form that I wish the
student ultimately to sing it with the metronome, at say
76, taking breath <i>only</i> at the rest-mark, and making the
<i>crescendo</i>&mdash;not, be it observed, by forcing the tone and
breath, but by a gradual pressing down of the breath.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Exercise 2 is a further one for the practice of joining notes
with the aid of the breath, without the least resemblance
to a jerk with either the sound or the breath. To sing
the exercise with advantage requires a very careful management
of the respiratory organs, and its continuous practice
is one of the best means of managing the breath. Having
inspired the breath after the manner already indicated
herein, proceed to sound the note F in a thin but firm and
steady tone, which you must gradually swell, by pressing
down the breath, as it were, into the following note G, which
you will continue to hold steadily by keeping down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
breath as long as you can. Though you raise your tone
of voice in passing from F to G, you must dispel from your
mind all notions of raising your breath or your <i>larynx</i>; it
is just the reverse; you must lower these. Remember a
golden rule&mdash;the higher your note the lower must it be
generated in your chest, and your breath must be under
the note supporting it, or there cannot possibly be any tone
there. On reaching the highest limit of this exercise, the
student will repeat the same operation down the scale,
which I need scarcely say is less difficult.</p>

<p>Exercise 3 may be timed 76 on your metronome. It
is a study to give freedom and flexibility to your voice.
None of the notes should be forced, and the upper notes
should be rendered with the mouth well open, and with a
quality of tone as similar as possible to that of the lower
notes. Breath should be taken (without losing time) at
the rest-marks. There should be no break or jump in the
tone, but rather it should be one unbroken stream of
melody, as marked in the first phrase. The voice, in this
exercise, should be constantly moving: no sooner should
you be sounding the first note of the phrase than you should
be moving to the second, from the second to the next, and
so on. Be careful to sing the intervals exactly in time,
and in descending to notes satisfy yourself that you are
singing the exact tone, and that with certainty. Indecision
is a grave fault in singing.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, "disirable" changed to "desirable". (It cannot be too strongly

and advantageous it is to be constantly singing exercises and solfeggi
in preference to songs.)</p>

<div class="hide-link"><p>In Exercise 8 on Page <a href="#Page_66">66</a>, the top D in the third
measure has been changed to sound as a D<span lang="en" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, in belief that the note
was affected by the flat at the beginning of the measure, and to stay in
character with the rest of the exercises.</p></div>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_73">73</a> and <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, "shool" changed to "school". (You will find its good
points equally insisted on in the oratorio school of singing, while its
defects should be avoided in any.)</p>

<p>In Exercise 11 on Page <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, the twelfth bar in the the original image
began with a quaver. To retain rhythmic integrity, this has been
edited to read as a crotchet.</p>

<p>In Exercise 6 on Page <a href="#Page_98">98</a>, the tenth and eleventh bar in the the original
image were reversed. For consistency, these bars have been corrected.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, "divisious" changed to "divisions". (Those who have ever
delighted as well as astonished us by their rapid manner of running
through divisions must have been naturally endowed with flexible
organs.)</p>

<p>In Exercise 4 on Page <a href="#Page_123">123</a>, the seventh bar in the the original image
began with an E. In order to maintain the pattern, this has been
edited to read as an F.</p>

<p>In Exercise 5 on Page <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, the twelfth bar in the the original image
contained four beats. The first note of the measure, which was a minim,
has been changed to a crotchet.</p>

<p>In Exercise 7 on Page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, the last measure
contained three beats. The last note of the exercise, which was printed as
a dotted minim, has been changed to a semibreve.</p>

<p>In Exercise 8 on Page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, the rhythm in the measure was originally
written as a crotchet, two quavers,
a crotchet, two quavers, and a crotchet, making five beats in the
measure of common time. The measure has been edited to read as a single
crotchet, followed by six quavers in order to retain four beats
in each measure.</p>
